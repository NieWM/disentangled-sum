Quantifying the degree of loss may help identify the most useful protein to use as an early biomarker of diabetic nephropathy. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Protein expression of synaptopodin, podocin and nephrin were quantified in 15 Type 2 diabetic renal biopsies and 12 control patients. We found statistically significant downregulation of synaptopodin (P<0.0001), podocin (P = 0.0002), and nephrin (P<0.0001) in kidney biopsies of diabetic nephropathy as compared with controls. Urinary nephrin levels (nephrinuria) were then measured in 66 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 10 healthy controls by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA). When divided into groups according to normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria, nephrinuria was found to be present in 100% of diabetic patients with micro- and macroalbuminuria, as well as 54% of patients with normoalbuminuria. Nephrinuria also correlated significantly with albuminuria (rho = 0.89, p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (rho = 0.32, p = 0.007), and correlated negatively with serum albumin (rho = -0.48, p<0.0001) and eGFR (rho = -0.33, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These data suggest that key podocyte-specific protein expressions are significantly and differentially downregulated in diabetic nephropathy. The finding that nephrinuria is observed in a majority of these normoalbuminuric patients demonstrates that it may precede microalbuminuria.

The age at which intelligence was measured differed between the samples. We used three methods of genetic analysis to examine the relationship between intelligence and lifespan: we calculated the proportion of the more intelligent twins who outlived their co-twin; we regressed within-twin-pair lifespan differences on within-twin-pair intelligence differences; and we used the resulting regression coefficients to model the additive genetic covariance.

MDSCs have also been reported to be associated with chronic inflammation. In advanced cancer, the T helper (Th) cell balance tends to shift from Th1 to Th2 predominance, and immune function, including cell-mediated immunity, is impaired by cytokines produced by Th2 cells. The present study examined the correlations between MDSC levels and inflammation, immune suppression, malnutrition, and poor prognosis in 155 patients with breast cancer. The levels of MDSCs in preoperative patients and in patients with recurrent breast cancer were significantly higher compared with postoperative patients, patients with recurrent breast cancer who received chemotherapy and healthy volunteers. The MDSC levels of preoperative patients were significantly positively correlated with interleukin (IL)-6 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein, and were negatively correlated with the production of interferon-\u03b3 and IL-12, serum concentration of rapid turnover protein, and the stimulation index. These patients were divided into two groups based on the levels of MDSCs. In preoperative patients with MDSC levels >1.0% of total PBMCs, the overall survival of patients with stage IV disease was significantly shorter compared with other disease stages, and was also significantly shorter compared with patients with MDSC levels <1.0% of total PBMCs.

Daily counts were aggregated by gender, age category (<20, 20-39, 40-64, 65-74, 75-84 and \u226585 years old), and place of residence in each of the seven regions: Northwestern Switzerland, Espace Mittelland (i.e. Swiss plateau), Lake Geneva, Zurich, Ticino, Central Switzerland and Eastern Switzerland (see definitions in the legend of table 1). This level of aggregation was chosen on the basis of homogeneity in the environmental, geographical characteristics and profile of the population. RESULTS Annual population", "gold": "QUESTION UNDER STUDY In Switzerland, summer 2015 was the second warmest summer for 150 years (after summer 2003). For summer 2003, a 6.9% excess mortality was estimated for Switzerland, which corresponded to 975 extra deaths. The impact of the heat in summer 2015 in Switzerland has not so far been evaluated. METHODS Daily age group-, gender- and region-specific all-cause excess mortality during summer (June-August) 2015 was estimated, based on predictions derived from quasi-Poisson regression models fitted to the daily mortality data for the 10 previous years. Estimates of excess mortality were derived for 1 June to 31 August, at national and regional level, as well as by month and for specific heat episodes identified in summer 2015 by use of seven different definitions. RESULTS 804 excess deaths (5.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0\u20127.9%) were estimated for summer 2015 compared with previous summers, with the highest percentage obtained for July (11.6%, 95% CI 3.7\u201219.4%). Seventy-seven percent of deaths occurred in people aged 75 years and older. Ticino (10.3%, 95% CI -1.8\u201222.4%), Northwestern Switzerland (9.5%, 95% CI 2.7\u201216.3%) and Espace Mittelland (8.9%, 95% CI 3.7\u201214.1%) showed highest excess mortality during this three-month period, whereas fewer deaths than expected (-3.3%, 95% CI -9.2\u20122.6%) were observed in Eastern Switzerland, the coldest region. The largest excess estimate of 23.7% was obtained during days when both maximum apparent and minimum night-time temperature reached extreme values (+32 and +20 \u00b0C, respectively), with 31.0% extra deaths for periods of three days or more.

SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS While a balanced microbiome is related to health, an imbalanced microbiome or dysbiosis is related to many health problems both within the gastro-intestinal tract, such as diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease, and outside the gastro-intestinal tract such as obesity and allergy. In this context, a strict regulation of probiotics with health claims is urgent, because the vast majority of these products are commercialized as food (supplements), claiming health benefits that are often not substantiated with clinically relevant evidence. The major indications of probiotics are in the area of the prevention and treatment of gastro-intestinal related disorders, but more data has become available on extra-intestinal indications. At least two published randomized controlled trials with the commercialized probiotic product in the claimed indication are a minimal condition before a claim can be sustained. Today, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii are the best-studied strains. Although adverse effects have sporadically been reported, these probiotics can be considered as safe.

The 2011 Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance survey from the United States reported high rates of overweight and obesity among high-school students. The survey found 15.2% of students to be obese and 13.5% to be overweight. Similar prevalence figures have been recorded among Australian adolescents; combined overweight/obesity prevalence was 28% in 2008. Obesity during this developmental period is associated with increases in blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, metabolic risk, cardiovascular disease and asthma. Recently, studies have gone beyond the medical sequelae to investigate outcomes of perceived functional health and wellbeing, or Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), associated with adolescent obesity.

Despite this well-established relationship, some adolescents with obesity do not display the expected HRQoL decreases. This study hypothesised weight perception as a moderator of the association between weight status and adolescent HRQoL. SUBJECTS/METHODS Subjects were secondary school students from an obesity prevention project in the Barwon South-West region of Victoria, Australia, entitled It's Your Move (N=3040). Measures included standardised body mass index (BMI-z; World Health Organization growth standards), weight perception and HRQoL, measured by the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Linear regression and average marginal effect analyses were conducted on cross-sectional baseline data to determine the significance of any interaction between weight perception and measured weight status in shaping adolescent HRQoL. RESULTS The BMI-z/perceived weight status interaction was significantly associated with adolescent HRQoL outcomes. Adolescents with BMI z-scores in the overweight/obesity range who perceived themselves as overweight had lower HRQoL than those who perceived themselves as 'about right.' Conversely, adolescents with BMI scores in the lower end of the normal range or in the thinness range who perceived themselves as underweight had lower HRQoL than those with 'about right' perceptions. CONCLUSIONS This was the first study to report third-variable impacts of a body-perception variable on the relationship between adolescent weight status and HRQoL. Adolescents' weight perceptions significantly moderated the relationship between overweight/obesity and reduced HRQoL. Adolescents who were outside the normal weight range and misperceived their objectively measured weight status enjoyed a higher HRQoL than adolescents whose weight perception was concordant with their actual weight status. These findings suggest that practitioners may need to exercise caution when educating adolescents about their weight status, as such 'reality checks' may negatively impact on adolescent HRQoL.

In October 1972, the admission policy moved towards care of patients with epilepsy and additional needs (medical or social) through the work of residents. METHODS We collected data of all residents who died between 1989 (when systematic efforts to obtain post-mortem started) and 2009 and studied their life-long evolution in terms of life expectancy, causes of death and evolution of seizures over a lifetime, correlated with brain and body pathology.

We report the lifelong course of epilepsy of an historical cohort of 235 subjects who were in residential care at the Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy: 122 had comprehensive post-mortem examination. The populations admitted as resident to the centre over time followed the evolution of society's perception of epilepsy. 'Early residents' (before 1972) were admitted for sheltered employment, escaping stigmatization, whereas 'later' residents with more severe epilepsies were admitted for care. Subjects admitted before 1972 were similar to subjects followed nowadays as outpatients, whereas patients admitted later with a higher burden of disabilities are often those in residential care. This long follow-up allowed exploration of a wide spectrum of epilepsies, affecting both subjects who were otherwise healthy and those with co-morbidities. Age at death showed a bimodal distribution with an early peak of mortality between 45-50 years old, whilst the remainder had life expectancy comparable to the general population. As a group, subjects who had post-mortem examination were not significantly different from patients who did not have post-mortem examination, but post-mortem examination provided data that were otherwise unavailable. For those who had post-mortem examination, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP, 18% of all deaths) did not fully explain the early mortality, to which co-morbidities contributed. High seizure frequency was a significant independent predictor of early death even after excluding SUDEP (e.g. reduction in years of life for those who had >4 seizures/month compared with those who had <1 seizure/month: 13 years; 95% confidence interval: 6-19; overall P = 0.0006). Those who survived to older age increasingly went into spontaneous remission lasting until death (in the whole cohort, 38/166, 23% of those who died in or after sixth decade). In subjects who had post-mortem examination, older age (odds ratio = 1.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.20) and presence of neuropathologically confirmed degenerative changes (that were not the cause of epilepsy) (odds ratio 7.14; 1.95-26.2) were independent predictors of terminal remission.

A putative effect of ACE inhibitors on AAA growth was tested separately by comparing 18-month growth rate of patients on ACE inhibitors (n = 82) and those not taking ACE inhibitors (n = 204).

BACKGROUND CT MPI has not been previously described with the 128-slice dual-source CT scanner, or with the complete evaluation of dynamic time-attenuation curves of the myocardium. METHODS Thirty-five patients underwent a stress CT MPI protocol. Complete time-attenuation curves of the myocardium were acquired using a novel scan mode, which acquires prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered axial images at 2 rapidly alternating positions. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) values of fixed and reversible defects obtained were compared between rest and stress. Findings on CT MPI were correlated to NMPI. Perfusion defects detected on CT were correlated to coronary stenoses detected on CT angiography (CTA) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). RESULTS There was a 1.5-fold difference between stress (1.21 +/- 0.31 cc/cc/min) and rest (0.82 +/- 0.22 cc/cc/min) MBF in normal tissue. In reversible defects, MBF was 0.65 +/- 0.21 cc/cc/min and 0.63 +/- 0.18 cc/cc/min at stress and rest, respectively. In fixed defects, the MBF was 0.57 +/- 0.22 cc/cc/min at stress and 0.54 +/- 0.23 cc/cc/min at rest. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CT MPI for identifying segments with perfusion defects was 0.83, 0.78, 0.79, and 0.82, respectively. ICA results were available for 30 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CT MPI compared with ICA were 0.95, 0.65, 0.78, and 0.79, respectively. The radiation dose for CT MPI was 9.15 +/- 1.32 mSv for the stress scan and 9.09 +/- 1.40 mSv for the rest scan.

In this context, we queried whether metabolic changes that occur in the 1st year postpartum vary in relation to gestational glucose tolerance status. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Three-hundred-and-ninety-two women underwent glucose challenge test (GCT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in pregnancy followed by repeat OGTT at both 3 months' postpartum and 12 months' postpartum. The antepartum testing defined four gestational glucose tolerance groups: GDM (n = 107); gestational impaired glucose tolerance (GIGT) (n = 75); abnormal GCT with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) on OGTT (abnormal GCT NGT) (n = 137); and normal GCT with NGT on OGTT (normal GCT NGT) (n = 73).

METHODS Data from a baseline survey of a maternal and newborn intervention in the districts of Pallisa, Kibuku and Kamuli, Eastern Uganda was analyzed. A total of 2237 women who had delivered in the last 12 months irrespective of birth outcome were interviewed in the survey. The primary outcome for this paper was neonatal mortality. The risk ratio (RR) was used to determine the factors associated with neonatal mortality using log-binomial model. RESULTS The neonatal mortality was found to be 34 per 1000 live births (95% CI = 27.1-42.8); Kamuli 31.9, Pallisa 36.5 and Kibuku 30.8. Factors associated with increased neonatal deaths were parity of 5+ (adj. RR =2.53, 95% CI =1.14-5.65) relative to parity of 4 and below, newborn low birth weight (adj.
