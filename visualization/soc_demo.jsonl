METHODS We apply logistic regression modelling to self-rated health in original cross-sectional survey data collected during mandatory conscription of Swiss male citizens in 2010 and 2011 (n = 23,975). RESULTS In comparison with sons whose parents completed mandatory schooling only, sons with parents who completed technical college or university were significantly more likely to report very good or excellent self-rated health. Parental economic capital was an important mediating factor in this regard. Number of books in the home (parental cultural capital), family economic circumstances (parental economic capital) and parental ties to influential people (parental social capital) were also independently associated with the self-rated health of the sons. Although sons in the highest educational stream tended to report better health than those in the lowest, we found little evidence for a health-producing intergenerational transmission of capitals via the education stream of the sons. Finally, the positive association between personal education and self-rated health was stronger among sons with relatively poorly educated parents and stronger among sons with parents who were relatively low in social capital.

The number of books in the home is an indicator of parental institutionalized cultural capital that represents a certificate of cultural competence which confers on its holder a conventional, constant and legally guaranteed value with respect to culture. The second primary form of capital, economic capital, refers to money and other assets such as property that can be directly converted into money. Social capital refers to resources embedded in relationships of mutual acquaintance or recognition. Access to the capitals held by others effectively serves to augment or enhance an individual's own stock of cultural and economic capitals.

Radiation carcinogenesis is a two-compartment problem: ionizing radiation can alter genomic sequence as a result of damage due to targeted effects (TE) from the interaction of energy and DNA; it can also alter phenotype and multicellular interactions that contribute to cancer by poorly understood non-targeted effects (NTE). Rather than being secondary to DNA damage and mutations that can initiate cancer, radiation NTE create the critical context in which to promote cancer. Systems biology modeling using comprehensive experimental data that integrates different levels of biological organization and time-scales is a means of identifying the key processes underlying the carcinogenic potential of high-LET radiation.

Initially, an Ebola patient is likely to complain of non-specific symptoms such as high fever, weakness, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and vomiting. However, their condition can deteriorate quickly and dramatically, to include rashes, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Those who die do so usually within two weeks of disease onset, often having exhibited the classical \"deep-set eyes, ghost-like expressionless face, and extreme lethargy\" [2]. Although it is rare, Ebola has a high case fatality rate. Just 2,306 cases have been reported since the disease was first recognised in 1976 in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC), but 1,527 (66%) of these individuals died. There remains no specific therapy, and neither is there", "gold": "BACKGROUND This paper documents and analyses some of the responses to the largest Ebola outbreak on record, which took place in Uganda between September 2000 and February 2001. Four hundred and twenty five people developed clinical symptoms in three geographically distinct parts of the country (Gulu, Masindi, and Mbarara), of whom 224 (53%) died. Given the focus of previous social scientific Ebola research on experiences in communities that have been directly affected, this article expands the lens to include responses to the outbreak in local, national, and international contexts over the course of the outbreak. METHODS Responses to the outbreak were gauged through the articles, editorials, cartoons, and letters that were published in the country's two main English language daily national newspapers: the New Vision and the Monitor (now the Daily Monitor). All the relevant pieces from these two sources over the course of the epidemic were cut out, entered onto a computer, and the originals filed. The three a priori codes, based on the local, national, and international levels, were expanded into six, to include issues that emerged inductively during analysis. The data within each code were subsequently worked into coherent, chronological narratives. RESULTS A total of 639 cuttings were included in the analysis. Strong and varied responses to the outbreak were identified from across the globe. These included, among others: confusion, anger, and serious stigma in affected communities; medical staff working themselves to exhaustion, with some quitting their posts; patients fleeing from hospitals; calls on spiritual forces for protection against infection; a well-coordinated national control strategy; and the imposition of some international travel restrictions. Responses varied both quantitatively and qualitatively according to the level (i.e. local, national, or international) at which they were manifested. CONCLUSIONS The Ugandan experience of 2000/2001 demonstrates that responses to an Ebola outbreak can be very dramatic, but perhaps disproportionate to the actual danger presented. An important objective for any future outbreak control strategy must be to prevent excessive fear, which, it is expected, would reduce stigma and other negative outcomes. To this end, the value of openness in the provision of public information, and critically, of being seen to be open, cannot be overstated.", "context": "BACKGROUND Ebola is a zoonotic disease, caused by bats that are currently suspected as the most likely reservoir species for the virus. Outbreaks occur when an individual comes into contact with an infected animal, with subsequent transmission between humans taking place through direct contact with the blood and/or secretions of an infected person. Whole families can therefore be infected when they are caring for a sick relative, or when preparing a body for burial. Serious amplification of an epidemic can also occur in hospitals and clinics if protective clothing is not worn by health care workers, or if needles and syringes are not sterile [6]. The largest Ebola outbreak on record first emerged in the environs of Lacor Hospital in the northern Ugandan town of Gulu, in September 2000.

MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY/PRINCIP", "gold": "Since scholarly interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has primarily focused on the synergies between social and economic performance, our understanding of how (and the conditions under which) companies use CSR to produce policy outcomes that work against public welfare has remained comparatively under-developed. In particular, little is known about how corporate decision-makers privately reconcile the conflicts between public and private interests, even though this is likely to be relevant to understanding the limitations of CSR as a means of aligning business activity with the broader public interest. This study addresses this issue using internal tobacco industry documents to explore British-American Tobacco's (BAT) thinking on CSR and its effects on the company's CSR Programme. The article presents a three-stage model of CSR development, based on Sykes and Matza's theory of techniques of neutralization, which links together: how BAT managers made sense of the company's declining political authority in the mid-1990s; how they subsequently justified the use of CSR as a tool of stakeholder management aimed at diffusing the political impact of public health advocates by breaking up political constituencies working towards evidence-based tobacco regulation; and how CSR works ideologically to shape stakeholders' perceptions of the relative merits of competing approaches to tobacco control. Our analysis has three implications for research and practice. First, it underlines the importance of approaching corporate managers' public comments on CSR critically and situating them in their economic, political and historical contexts. Second, it illustrates the importance of focusing on the political aims and effects of CSR.

We therefore quantified the impact of equalizing the distribution of six risk factors for mortality: smoking, overweight, lack of physical exercise, lack of social participation, low income, and economic inactivity. METHODS We collected and harmonized data on mortality and risk factors by educational level for 21 European populations in the early 2000s. The impact of the risk factors on mortality in each educational group was determined using Population Attributable Fractions. We estimated the impact on inequalities in mortality of two scenarios: a theoretical upward levelling scenario in which inequalities in the risk factor were completely eliminated, and a more realistic best practice scenario, in which inequalities in the risk factor were reduced to those seen in the country with the smallest inequalities for that risk factor. FINDINGS In general, upward levelling of inequalities in smoking, low income and economic inactivity hold the greatest potential for reducing inequalities in mortality. While the importance of low income is similar across Europe, smoking is more important in the North and East, and overweight in the South. On the basis of best practice scenarios the potential for reducing inequalities in mortality is often smaller, but still substantial in many countries for smoking and physical inactivity. INTERPRETATION Theoretically, there is a great potential for reducing inequalities in mortality in most European countries, for example by equity-oriented tobacco control policies, income redistribution and employment policies. Although it is necessary to achieve substantial degrees of upward levelling to make a notable difference for inequalities in mortality, the existence of best practice countries with more favourable distributions for some of these risk factors suggests that this is feasible.", "context": "BACKGROUND Inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups are increasingly recognized as one of the main challenges for health policy.

These include behavioural risk factors such as tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, but more 'upstream' social and economic risk factors like social isolation, low income, unemployment, and occupational risks have been shown to contribute as well [4-8]. On the basis of these explanatory findings, policy proposals have been developed, both at the national level [9-14] and internationally (1).

DISCUSSION Research from Ethiopia and Norway demonstrates that the rigid enforcement of directly observed treatment conflicts with patient autonomy, dignity and integrity. The treatment practices, especially when imposed in its strictest forms, expose those who have Tuberculosis to extra burdens and costs. Socially disadvantaged groups, such as the homeless, those employed as day labourers and those lacking rights as employees, face the highest burdens.

These studies typically explain tendency to cooperation by dividing people in proself and prosocial types, or appealing to forms of external control or, in iterated social dilemmas, to long-term strategies.

Our findings suggest that while 'translation' is a widely used metaphor in medicine, it constrains how we conceptualise and study the link between knowledge and practice. The 'translation' metaphor has, arguably, led to particular difficulties in the fields of 'evidence-based management' and 'evidence-based policymaking' - where it seems that knowledge obstinately refuses to be driven unproblematically into practice. Many non-medical disciplines such as philosophy, sociology and organization science conceptualise knowledge very differently, as being (for example) 'created', 'constructed', 'embodied', 'performed' and 'collectively negotiated' - and also as being value-laden and tending to serve the vested interests of dominant \u00e9lites. We propose that applying this wider range of metaphors and models would allow us to research the link between knowledge and practice in more creative and critical ways.

In 2006, the US National Institute of Health introduced its Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program with the goal of funding 60 centres by 2012, at an annual cost of US$500 million.2 In the same year, the UK Cooksey Report set out an ambitious strategy for translational research in basic and clinical sciences.3 This led to the establishment of the Office for Strategic Coordination of Health Research, with \u2018translational medicine\u2019 featuring prominently in its \u00a31.7 billion annual budget. Of 27 journals containing the word \u2018Translational\u2019 listed on the NCBI index of medical journals, 18 have been launched since 2008.As the T1/T2 taxonomy suggests, the terms \u2018knowledge translation\u2019 and \u2018transferrability\u2019 are associated with two separate processes \u2013(a) incorporation of basic science innovations into the", "contribution": "Drawing mainly on disciplines outside medicine, we introduce a range of alternative metaphors and models which highlight the fundamentally social ways in which knowledge emerges, circulates and gets applied in practice.

This meaning conflates time such that individuals who lived at different times, and therefore never interacted directly, may be considered members of the same population. In this context, a random sample drawn from a population of N individuals includes n (where) individuals from generation t but none from n \u2264 1 or t \u03e91. By contrast, an archaeologist may use the term \"Population\". The central goal is to systematically address what extent methods were originally developed to assess neutrality in genes sampled from an idealized population are appropriate for investigating modes of cultural transmission in culture variants from benthic communities in two bays in Texas; Bentley, Hahn, and Shennan 2004; Holdaway and Wandsnider 2008; and Stern 1993, 1994).

However, it remains unclear to what extent methods originally developed to assess neutrality in genes sampled from a population at a single point in time are applicable to cultural variants sampled from assemblages. This report applies a suite of previously published methods to assemblages formed under unbiased cultural transmission. The results show that, even under the controlled conditions afforded by computer simulation, all but one method (the variants frequency approach) fail to identify unbiased cultural transmission in samples collected from moderately to severely time-averaged assemblages. While it is encouraging that the method that is best at identifying unbiased cultural transmission in simulated time-averaged data also is relatively robust to relative sample size, additional work is needed to determine whether even the variants frequency approach is p...", "context": "Anthropologists are interested in identifying which modes of social learning were used in past societies because it is thought that the type of cultural transmission practiced may provide some insight into the psychology of the practitioners. But there are also other reasons for investigating the ways in which cultural traits were transmitted among individuals in the past. Here, I review four methods that have previously been used to assess cultural transmission in time-transgressive assemblages: (1) population geneticists most commonly use the term \"population\" to refer to a set of individuals responsible for the material record of a period or phase within a given geographic region; (2) common-trait trimming and rare-trimming; and (3) results bias.

Using these methods, I find that the number of individuals who are alive at the same time is significantly higher than any of the instantaneous samples collected from the living communities. In addition, I also show that the total number of species present in death assemblage is greater than observed at any time in the living community (see also Staff and Powell 1988).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1086/674873", "title": "Cultural Transmission and Diversity in Time-Averaged Assemblages"}
{"distilbart": "We argue that the reasons underlying researchers' societal engagement are driven by a more complex set of factors beyond immediate benefits. Our proposed approach focuses on a core element of the scientific process: setting research questions (Gl\u00e4ser, 2012).

In this paper, we propose to explore academics\u2019 willingness to let research questions and agendas (research trajectory) to be shaped with involvement of third parties. We indirectly analyse these changes in the research trajectory by exploring the stages of the research cycle, and whether they are somehow influenced by non-academic inputs.

We ask what kinds of characteristics define those researchers who are more \u2018open\u2019 to creating usable knowledge. Our empirical study analyses a sample of 1583 researchers working at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). Results demonstrate that it is personal factors (academic identity and past experience) that determine which researchers have open behaviours. The paper concludes that policies to encourage external engagement should focus on experiences which legitimate and validate knowledge produced through user encounters, both at the academic formation career stage as well as through providing ongoing opportunities to engage with third parties.", "context": "An academic debate is emerging considering academic behaviours and intentions towards engagement as part of better understanding the relationship between societal engagement and academic research. This in turn hinders developing effective interventions and instruments to stimulating academic research being more useful for users, and hence better contributing to growth, welfare and solving the grand societal challenges of the 21st century. We seek to contribute to this debate by exploring one under-researched dimension of academic behaviour: openness to external (non-academic) influences on the research agenda. In parallel with practical problems in rigorously measuring motivation there remains a pressing need to understand the factors which influence whether academics engage with external partners, and whether they are prepared to make efforts to make their research useful for society.

The survey asks about general political attitudes, demographic factors, assessment of roll call voting choices, and political information.

We show that while respondents recruited via M Turk are often more representative of the US population than in-person convenience samples, MTurK respondents are less representative than subjects in Internet-based panels or national probability samples. However, they do not explore the relationship between these key variables of interest. By presenting the joint distributions of several of these variables we are able to analyze the properties of Mturk samples within the United States as they cut across these different categories.
