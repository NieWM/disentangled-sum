Nevertheless, the discovery of bat herpesviruses is geographica lly uneven. Of the various bat species tested to date, only a few were from the New World. Seeking to investigate the distribution and diversity of herpesviruses circulating in neotropical bats, we carried out molecular screening of 195 blood DNA samples from 11 species of three bat families (Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae, and Molossidae). Using polymerase chain reaction amplificatio n, with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs of the herpesvir us DNA polymerase and Glycoprotein B genes, we characterized novel viral sequences from all tested species. BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, as well as phylogenetic analyses confirmed that they all belonged to the Herpesviridae family, of the Betaand Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. Fourteen partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, of which three beta-and 11 gamma-herpesviruses, were detected. A total of 12 partial Glycoprotein B gene sequences, all gamma-herpesviruses, were characterized. Every sequence was specific to a bat species and in some species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus rubiginosus) multiple viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses of beta-and gammaherpesvir us sequences led to the identification of bat-specific clades. Those composed of sequences obtained from different bat species belonging to distinct subfamilies follow the taxonomy of bats. This study confirms the astonishing diversity of bat herpesviruses and broadens our knowledge of their host range. Nevertheless, it also emphasizes the fact that, to better appreciate the evolutionary history of these viruses, much remains to be done at various taxonomic levels.", "context": "Bats are highly diverse in terms of their anatomy and lifestyles, and have different diets (insectivorous, frugivores, nectarivoro us, carnivorous, piscivorous or hematophagous).

Of the total, 42% were used in a functional way, in 54 different medicines. The principal functional native species identified in the review were Aristotelia chilensis and Berberis microphylla. In the case study 20 PEFF were in current use (50% were native), and consensus values were similar for native and exotic species. These were used in 44 different local foods, mainly as fresh fruit. Only 30% were recognized for their functional value by inhabitants (mainly as gastrointestinal and respiratory treatments). The species with the highest functional consensus were the exotic Sambucus nigra and Rosa rubiginosa, followed by the native A. chilensis, Ribes magellanicum and B. microphylla. Infusions also constituted important local functional foods. Conclusions: This survey highlights the importance of studying the different local functional foods to depict the biocultural diversity of a human society.

{"distilbart": "Circular DNA without centromeres has segregation biases that are similar to those for rDNA and two models have been suggested to explain their tendency to segregate towards the mother cell. In the active retention model, rDNA is actively retained in the nucleus by the nuclear pore complexes via the TREX-2 and SAGA complex, which are suggested to tether the circular DNA to nuclear periphery of the mother cells. The alternative model, known as the diffusion model, suggests that segregation of non-rDNA circles is determined by passive diffusion from the mother nucleus to the daughter nucleus under mitosis and thereby lead to a segregation bias. The passive model is based on LYS2 circles with and without replication origin that distribute randomly across the nucleus rather than being associated to the nuclear envelope. The different observations of circle distributions during mitosis, suggest that more than one mechanism for missegregation might exist. Other genetic elements on circular DNA can ensure more equal segregation between mother and daughter cells.", "gold": "Circular DNA of chromosomal origin form from all parts of eukaryotic genomes. In yeast, circular rDNA accumulates as cells divide, contributing to replicative aging. However, little is known about how other chromosome-derived circles segregate and contribute to genetic variation as cells age. We identified circular DNA across the genome of young S. cerevisiae populations and their aged descendants. Young cells had highly diverse circular DNA populations, but lost 94% of the different circular DNA after 20 divisions. Circles present in both young and old cells were characterized by replication origins and included circles from unique regions of the genome, rDNA circles and telomeric Y' circles. The loss in genetic heterogeneity in aged cells was accompanied by massive accumulation of rDNA circles >95% of all circular DNA. We discovered circles had flexible inherence patterns. Glucose limited conditions selected for cells with glucose-transporter gene circles, [HXT6/7 circle ], and up to 50% of cells in a population carried them. [HXT6/7 circle ] cells were eventually substituted by cells carrying stable chromosomal HXT6 HXT6/7 HXT7 amplifications, suggesting circular DNA were intermediates in chromosomal amplifications. In conclusion, DNA circles can offer a flexible adaptive solution but cells lose genetic heterogeneity from circular DNA as they undergo replicative aging. Recent studies have shown that circular DNA form from all parts of eukaryotic genomes (20-22). While the majority of the circular DNA are smaller than 1 kilobase (kb) (20, 22, 23), some circular DNA are large enough to fully span transposons (24), centromeres, genes, and replication origins (13, 20, 22, 24-26). Hence, circular DNA can acquire all the genetic elements required for the replication and propagation of the genetic material present on them. Yet, a global overview of how circular DNA segregates and affects aging is still missing. To obtain a global overview of how circular DNA segregates, we have applied the yeast Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) to obtain young and the corresponding aged cells (27) and combined it with our methods for purification and mapping of circular DNA (28, 29). This has allowed us to dissect the inheritance pattern of circular DNA while S. cerevisiae cells undergo replicative aging. To get a robust measure of the different circular DNA species present in young and aging cells, we have developed novel methods for mapping of circular DNA from both uniquely mappable and repetitive regions of the S. cerevisiae genome.

Accumulation of circular rDNA is associated with a massive increase in ribosomal rRNA levels and the accumulation can reduce the number of divisions a cell undergo before dying (1). Replicative aging is not specifically associated with circular DNA but rather it appears to be the accumulation of circular DNA in general that causes a shorter lifespan of the mother cell (4). The segregation kinetics, inferred from a small number of model circles, can be generalized to circular DNA formed from other parts of the genome. However, our knowledge about segregation of other circular DNA species of chromosomal origin is based on a few model circles with a small range of genetic markers (4, 6, 7, 11).

They can be treated as long term survivors (cured population) in the context of lifetime data analysis. In this article, we present some statistical methods to estimate the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India. Proportional hazards mixture cure model is used to estimate the cure fraction and the effect of covariates gender and age on lifetime. The data available on website 'https://api.cvoid19india.org' is used in this study. We can see that, the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India is more than 90%, which is indeed an optimistic information.", "context": "The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a global health crisis since January 2020. The first case was reported in many studies on COVID- 19 patient data using SIR models and other popular statistical techniques (Nadia and Hazem, 2020 and Waquas et al., 2020). In the present paper, our goal is to analyse COVID -19 patient data from India, using lifetime data models which are widely used in epidemiological studies and public health research (Lee and Go, 1997 and Cole and Hudgens, 2010). We can use mixture cure models, the basic cure model proposed by Boag (1949) to analyse this data. The mixture cure model assumes that the population under study is a mixture of susceptible (uncured)individuals who may experience the event of interest, and non-susceptible (cured) individuals who will never experience it. Cox's PH model for cured data is used to", "contribution": "In this paper, we analyse COVID-19 patient data from India using statistical techniques in lifetime data analysis. We use Kaplan Meier estimate of the survivor function to get a basic information about the presence of long term survivors in the population. The effect of covariates on lifetime is analysed using proportional hazards model and the cure fraction is estimated in presence of covariate covariates.", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.30.20117804v1?rss=1", "title": "Statistical methods for estimating cure fraction of COVID-19 patients in India"}
{"distilbart": "In this paper, we consider the problem of finding 1 infected person in a non-adaptive way. The goal is to identify positive and negative samples with the least expected number of tests (or more likely negative) test results. We can use an adaptive strategy, meaning that we can choose the pools depending on the earlier test results, but also considering the following realistic refinements and goals. This makes sense if we want to develop mathematical techniques, but these papers are too far from direct applications. The current COVID-19 epidemic has created an urgent need for a more application-oriented summary and extension of our knowledge about testing algorithms, considering the mathematically ugly but practically important details. The mathematical model.", "gold": "We have a large number of samples and we want to find the infected ones using as few number of tests as possible. We can use group testing which tells about a small group of people whether at least one of them is infected. Group testing is particularly efficient if the infection rate is low. The goal of this article is to summarize and extend the mathematical knowledge about the most efficient group testing algorithms. focusing on real-life applications instead of pure mathematical motivations and approaches.", "context": "In this paper, we present a mathematical model for group testing algorithms. We have N number of samples, each of them is positive with a (small) probability P, independently, and the rest are negative. Pool means a set of at most K samples. We can test a pool, and it outputs whether there is at least one positive sample in the pool. The goal is to identify the positive samples with the least expected number of tests T. We can use an adaptive strategy, meaning that we can choose the pools depending on the earlier test results. In more detail, the samples are continuously arriving at a speed of our choice (roughly), and we can make tests in rounds with a limited testing capacity (approx. 100) per round. We prefer getting faster results compared to the arrival time of the sample, and we also prefer using our full testing capacity. There is a small probability of false test results, and larger the pool size the smaller the pool sizes the lower", "contribution": "We have N number of samples, each of them is positive with a (small) probability P, independently, and the rest are negative. We can test a pool, and it outputs whether there is at least one positive sample in the pool. Most test results are clearly positive or negative, but there are some likely positive or likely negative results with different confidence levels. Samples have a level of positivity, pooling takes approximately the average of these levels, and pools with lower positive levels are more likely to give negative (or more likely negative) test results.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02388v1.pdf", "title": "Application-oriented mathematical algorithms for group testing"}
