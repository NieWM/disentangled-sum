Given a smooth submanifold $H \subset M$ of codimension $k\geq 1$, we find conditions on the pair $(\{\phi_h\},H)$ for which $$ \Big|\int_H\phi_hd\sigma_H\Big|=o(h^{\frac{1-k}{2}}),\qquad h\to 0^+. _	1
In particular, we show that the upper bound holds for any $H$ if $(M,g)$ is surface with Anosov geodesic flow or a manifold of constant negative curvature. @	1
The results are obtained by characterizing the behavior of the defect measures of eigenfunctions with maximal averages. @	1
Let $(M,g)$ be a smooth, compact Riemannian manifold and $\{\phi_h\}$ an $L^2$-normalized sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions, $-h^2\Delta_g\phi_h=\phi_h$. `	0
$$ One such condition is that the set of conormal directions to $H$ that are recurrent has measure $0$. @	0
Analysis of recombination rates along rice chromosomes confirms a positive correlation between the occurrence of TAGs and recombination rate, as found in Arabidopsis. _	1
We speculate that these observations reflect an evolutionary trend in which successful tandem duplication involves genes either at the end of biochemical pathways or in flexible steps in a pathway, for which fluctuation in copy number is unlikely to affect downstream genes. @	1
In Arabidopsis, tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs) comprise .10% of the genes in the genome. `	0
These duplicated genes represent a rich template for genetic innovation, but little is known of the evolutionary forces governing their generation and maintenance. `	0
Here we compare the organization and evolution of TAGs between Arabidopsis and rice, two plant genomes that diverged ;150 million years ago. `	0
TAGs from the two genomes are similar in a number of respects, including the proportion of genes that are tandemly arrayed, the number of genes within an array, the number of tandem arrays, and the dearth of TAGs relative to single copy genes in centromeric regions. _	0
TAGs are also biased functionally relative to duplicated, nontandemly arrayed genes. _	0
In both genomes, TAGs are enriched for genes that encode membrane proteins and function in ''abiotic and biotic stress'' but underrepresented for genes involved in transcription and DNA or RNA binding functions. @	0
Despite differences in the age distribution of tandem arrays, the striking similarities between rice and Arabidopsis indicate similar mechanisms of TAG generation and maintenance. @	0
This article reviews the relapse rate after cessation of treatment with NAs in chronic hepatitis B patients with the goal of identifying possible predictive factors of relapse. @	1
The introduction of nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) for oral antiviral therapy has dramatically improved the clinical outcome of patients with chronic hepatitis B. NAs appear to be safe and induce potent suppression of viral replication. `	0
However, they are associated with a low rate of HBsAg seroclearance, the gold standard of successful treatment, and also with a relatively high rate of virological relapse after discontinuation. `	0
As a result, long-term treatment is needed. _	0
The optimal duration of NA treatment currently remains unclear, nevertheless in some patients NA treatment can be stopped with a relatively low probability of relapse. _	0
Whether NAs are able to induce a sustained off-treatment response is an important area for research. @	0
Global location sensing (gls) loggers were used in combination with the trophic ecology of tracked individuals, inferred from the isotopic signatures of wing feathers. `	1
Results suggest that these two Macaronesian shearwater sub-populations do segregate during the non-breeding period in some 'sub-population-specific' regions, by responding to different oceanographic characteristics (habitat modelling). _	1
Within these disparate areas, both sub-populations behave differently (at-sea activity) and prey on disparate trophic niches (stable isotope analysis). _	1
Finally, when comparing to the results of former studies reporting on the spatial, behavioural and trophic choices of Macaronesian shearwater populations breeding on Azores and Canary Islands, we realized the high ecological plasticity of this species inhabiting and foraging over the North-East Atlantic Ocean. @	1
In this work we investigated the between-colony spatial, behavioural and trophic segregation of two sub-populations of the elusive Macaronesian shearwaters Puffinus baroli breeding only ~340 km apart in Cima Islet (Porto Santo Island) and Selvagem Grande Island. `	0
One hypothesis would be that each sub-population have evolved and adapted to feed on particular and 'sub-population-specific' resources, and the segregation observed at the three different levels (spatial, behavioural and trophic) might be in fact a result of such adaptation, from the emergence of 'cultural foraging patterns'. @	0
We report on the development of self‐immolative nanoparticles capable of simultaneously delivering miR‐34a mimic and targeting dysregulated polyamine metabolism in cancer. `	1
The nanoparticles were prepared from a biodegradable polycationic prodrug, named DSS‐BEN, which was synthesized from a polyamine analog N1,N11‐bisethylnorspermine (BENSpm). `	1
The nanoparticles were selectively disassembled in the cytoplasm where they released miRNA. _	1
Glutathione (GSH)‐induced degradation of self‐immolative linkers released BENSpm from the DSS‐BEN polymers. _	1
MiR‐34a mimic was effectively delivered to cancer cells as evidenced by upregulation of intracellular miR‐34a and downregulation of Bcl‐2 as one of the downstream targets of miR‐34a. _	1
Intracellular BENSpm generated from the degraded nanoparticles induced the expression of rate‐limiting enzymes in polyamine catabolism (SMOX, SSAT) and depleted cellular natural polyamines. _	1
Simultaneous regulation of polyamine metabolism and miR‐34a expression by DSS‐BEN/miR‐34a not only enhanced cancer cell killing in cultured human colon cancer cells, but also improved antitumor activity in vivo. @	1
The reported findings validate the self‐immolative nanoparticles as delivery vectors of therapeutic miRNA capable of simultaneously targeting dysregulated polyamine metabolism in cancer, thereby providing an elegant and efficient approach to combination nanomedicines. @	1
Abstract Combination of anticancer drugs with therapeutic microRNA (miRNA) has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy. `	0
However, the promise is hampered by a lack of desirable delivery systems. `	0

We present an experiment to compare a standard, minimally distinguishing algorithm for the generation of relational referring expressions with two alternatives that produce overspecified descriptions. `	1
The experiment shows that discrimination which normally plays a major role in the disambiguation task is also a major influence in referential overspecification, even though disambiguation is in principle not relevant. _	1
METHODS This study represents data from the biopsy samples of six individuals suffering from UC. `	1
The samples were collected by colonoscopy and were processed immediately for isolation of DNA. _	1
Mucosal microbiota was analyzed by means of 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina high throughput sequencing. _	1
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed to determine total bacterial abundances. _	1
RESULTS Analysis of 23,927 OTUs demonstrated a significant reduction of bacterial diversity consistently from phylum to species level (p < 0.05) for individuals suffering from severe stage of UC. @	1
Significant increase in abundance of unusual aerobes and facultative anaerobes, including members from the phylum Proteobacteria (p- = 0.031) was also observed. @	1
A 10 fold increase in the total bacterial count was detected in patients suffering from severe inflammatory stage (2.98 +/-0.49 E + 09/ml) when compared with patients with moderate (1.03+/-0.29 E + 08/ml) and mild (1.76 +/-0.34 E + 08/ml) stages of inflammation. @	1
CONCLUSION The reduction of bacterial diversity with an increase in the total bacterial count indicates a shift of bacterial communities which signifies dysbiosis and dysanaerobiosis at the mucosal level for patients suffering from UC. @	1
BACKGROUND The healthy human intestine is represented by the presence of bacterial communities predominantly belonging to obligate anaerobes; however disparity and dysanaerobiosis in intestinal microflora may lead to the progression of ulcerative colitis (UC). `	0
The foremost aim of this study is to consider and compare the gut microbiota composition in patients suffering from different stages of UC. `	0
We extend the tools of higher-order Fourier analysis to analyze functions over general fields. `	1
Using these new tools, we revisit the results in the above areas. `	1
* For any fixed finite field $\mathbb{K}$, we show that the list decoding radius of the generalized Reed Muller code over $\mathbb{K}$ equals the minimum distance of the code. _	1
* For any fixed finite field $\mathbb{K}$, we give a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether a given polynomial $P: \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{K}$ can be decomposed as a particular composition of lesser degree polynomials. _	1
* For any fixed finite field $\mathbb{K}$, we prove that all locally characterized affine-invariant properties of functions $f: \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{K}$ are testable with one-sided error. @	1
Moreover, we show that for any fixed finite field $\mathbb{F}$, an affine-invariant property of functions $f: \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{F}$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is a growing field extension over $\mathbb{F}$, is testable if it is locally characterized by constraints of bounded weight. @	1
Higher-order Fourier analysis, developed over prime fields, has been recently used in different areas of computer science, including list decoding, algorithmic decomposition and testing. `	0
Previously, this had been proved over prime fields [BL14] and for the case when $|\mathbb{K}|-1$ divides the order of the code [GKZ08]. _	0
This had been previously established over prime fields [Bha14, BHT15]. @	0
The same result was known when $\mathbb{K}$ is prime [BFHHL13] and when the property is linear [KS08]. @	0
AbstractWe propose a new combination of the bivariate Shepard operators [10] by the three point Lidstone polynomials introduced in [12] . `	1
The new combination inherits both degree of exactness and Lidstone interpolation conditions at each node, which characterize the interpolation polynomial. _	1
These new operators …nd application to the scattered data interpolation problem when supplementary second order derivative data are given [22] . @	0
Numerical comparison with other well known combinations are presented. @	0
In CF1 mice, superovulation has little effect on development to blastocyst, but enforces a greater degree of lineage restriction than natural breeding, most likely through constraints imposed by the zona pellucida. @	1
It remains controversial whether blastomeres of 2-cell stage mouse embryos show bias in their contribution to the blastocyst and whether there is any effect of superovulation. `	0
Two-cell stage embryos from CF1 mice were derived by either natural breeding (N) or superovulation (S) and cultured in vitro. `	0
At blastocyst, inner cell mass and trophectoderm were distinguished by Cdx2 and Oct4 immunostaining. `	0
A fluorescent dye (CM-Dil) was also used to tag individual blastomeres at the 2-cell stage, and the descendant cells identified by their red fluorescence. _	0
S and N embryos developed to blastocyst at the same rate and contained a similar number of cells. _	0
However, with S embryos, the descendants of the blastomere labeled with CM-DiI contributed predominantly to either the embryonic or abembryonic pole about 70% of the time, whereas most N embryos displayed random patterning, with no restriction to one or other of the poles. _	0
In S-embryos, but not N-embryos, the leading blastomere at second cleavage contributed preferentially to the embryonic pole of the blastocyst and the lagging blastomere to the abembryonic pole and hence mural trophectoderm. @	0
In addition, a tetrahedral rather than a flat morphology at the 4-cell stage of S-embryos was strongly biased to displaying the embryonic/abembryonic pattern at blastocyst. @	0
In contrast, S-embryos lacking a zona pellucida resembled N embryos in their patterning. @	0
METHODS A systematic search was performed using the electronic databases Pubmed and Embase. `	1
The psychometric properties of the questionnaires were determined based on the COSMIN taxonomy of measurement properties and definitions for health-related patient-reported outcomes and the COSMIN checklist using preset psychometric criteria. _	1
The Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) proved to be identical to the Modified Self-report Symptom Inventory. _	1
All FHS questionnaires obtained poor overall methodological quality scores for most measurement properties. @	1
CONCLUSIONS The retrieved FHS questionnaires need psychometric reevaluation; if the overall methodological quality shows satisfactory improvement on most measurement properties, the use of the questionnaires in daily clinic and research can be justified. @	1
However, in case of insufficient validity and/or reliability scores, new FHS questionnaires need to be developed using and reporting on preestablished psychometric criteria as recommended in literature. @	1
INTRODUCTION Questionnaires on Functional Health Status (FHS) are part of the assessment of oropharyngeal dysphagia. `	0
OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the psychometric properties of English-language FHS questionnaires in adults with oropharyngeal dysphagia. `	0
RESULTS Three questionnaires were included: the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), the Swallowing Outcome after Laryngectomy (SOAL), and the Self-report Symptom Inventory. _	0
Here, we report a shotgun proteomic analysis of P. profundum grown at atmospheric compared to high pressure using label-free quantitation and mass spectrometry analysis. _	1
We have identified differentially expressed proteins involved in high pressure adaptation, which have been previously reported using other methods. _	1
Proteins involved in key metabolic pathways were also identified as being differentially expressed. _	1
Proteins involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were up-regulated at high pressure. _	1
Conversely, several proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were up-regulated at atmospheric pressure. @	1
Some of the proteins that were differentially identified are regulated directly in response to the physical impact of pressure. @	1
Photobacterium profundum SS9 is a Gram-negative bacterium, originally collected from the Sulu Sea. `	0
Its genome consists of two chromosomes and a 80 kb plasmid. `	0
Although it can grow under a wide range of pressures, P. profundum grows optimally at 28 MPa and 15°C. `	0
Its ability to grow at atmospheric pressure allows for both easy genetic manipulation and culture, making it a model organism to study piezophily. `	0
The expression of some proteins involved in nutrient transport or assimilation, are likely to be directly regulated by pressure. @	0
In a natural environment, different hydrostatic pressures represent distinct ecosystems with their own particular nutrient limitations and abundances. @	0
However, the only variable considered in this study was atmospheric pressure. @	0
METHODS We searched MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases through July 2012, using search terms related to diabetes mellitus, cancer, and thyroid cancer. `	1
We conducted a meta-analysis of the risk of incidence of thyroid cancer from pre-existing diabetes. `	1
The risks were estimated using random-effects model and sensitivity test for the studies which reported risk estimates and used different definition of DM. _	1
RESULTS Compared with individuals without DM, the patients with DM were at 1.34-fold higher risk for thyroid cancer (95% CI 1.11-1.63). @	1
However, there was heterogeneity in the results (p<0.0001). @	1
Sensitivity tests and studies judged to be high quality did not show heterogeneity and DM was associated with higher risk for thyroid cancer in these sub-analyses (both of RRs = 1.18, 95% CIs 1.08-1.28). @	1
DM was associated with a 1.38-fold increased risk of thyroid cancer in women (95% CI 1.13-1.67) after sensitivity test. @	1
Risk of thyroid cancer in men did not remain significant (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.80-1.53). @	1
CONCLUSIONS Compared with their non-diabetic counterparts, women with pre-existing DM have an increased risk of thyroid cancer. @	1
INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for endocrine cancers; however, the association with thyroid cancer is not clear. `	0
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between thyroid cancer and DM. `	0

We describe a new tool, called PointCloudXplore (PCX), that supports effective 3D gene expression data exploration. `	1
PCX is a visualization tool that uses the established visualization techniques of multiple views, brushing, and linking to support the analysis of high-dimensional datasets that describe many genes’ expression. `	1
Each of the views in PointCloudXplore shows a different gene expression data property. _	1
We discuss on parallel coordinates as one example abstract data view currently available in PCX. @	1
We have developed several ex- tensions to standard parallel coordinates to facilitate brushing and the visualization of 3D gene expression data. @	1

Brushing is used to select and em- phasize data associated with deﬁned subsets of embryo cells within a view. _	0
Linking is used to show in additional views the expression data for a group of cells that have ﬁrst been highlighted as a brush in a single view, allowing further data subset properties to be determined. _	0
In PCX, physical views of the data are linked to abstract data displays such as parallel coordinates. _	0
Physical views show the spatial relationships between different genes’ expression patterns within an embryo. @	0

The proposed mathematical model is based on mixed-integer programming and helps minimizing the total cost. `	1
Total costs include the expenditure of establishing new centers, producing new products, cargo transport in the network, and disposal. _	1
Four types of tuned metaheuristic algorithms were used, which are hybrid forms of genetic and firefly algorithms. @	1
Computational results reveal that iterative sequentialization hybrid provides better solution compared with the other approaches in large size. @	1
This paper investigates a closed-loop supply chain network, including plants, demand centers, as well as collection centers, and disposal centers. `	0
In forward flow, the products are directly sent to demand centers, after being produced by plants, but in the reverse flow, reused products are returned to collection centers and, after investigating, are partly sent to disposal centers and the other part is resent to plants for remanufacturing. `	0
The model aims to answer these two questions. _	0
(1) What number and in which places the plants, collection centers, and disposal centers will be constructed. _	0
(2) What amount of products will be flowing in each segment of the chain, in order to minimize the total cost. @	0
Finally an adequate number of instances are generated to analyse the behavior of proposed algorithms. @	0
In this study, mouse strains carrying reporters linked to Pax3 alleles were used to map the fate of CNC cells in embryos which were either Pax3-sufficient (expressing one or two functional Pax3 alleles) or Pax3-deficient (expressing two null Pax3 alleles), and in which p53 had been inactivated or not. _	1
Migrating CNC cells were observed in both Pax3-sufficient and -deficient embryos, but CNC cells were sparse and disorganized in Pax3-deficient embryos as migration progressed. @	1
The defective migration was associated with increased cell death. @	1
Suppression of p53, either by null mutation of the p53 gene, or administration of a p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-alpha, prevented the defective CNC migration and apoptosis in Pax3-deficient embryos, and also restored proper development of cardiac outflow tracts. @	1
These results indicate that Pax3 is required for cardiac outflow tract septation because it blocks p53-dependent processes during CNC migration. @	1
During neural tube closure, Pax3 is required to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. `	0
Pax3 is also required for migration of cardiac neural crest (CNC) from the neural tube to the heart and septation of the primitive single cardiac outflow tract into the aorta and pulmonary arteries. `	0
Whether Pax3 is required for CNC migration and outflow tract septation by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis is not known. _	0
We used molecular data and phenotypic traits to unravel speciation processes and phylogeographic patterns in Aurelia.ResultsMitochondrial and nuclear DNA data (16S and ITS-1/5.8S rDNA) from 66 world-wide sampled specimens reveal star-like tree topologies, unambiguously differentiating 7 (mtDNA) and 8 (ncDNA) genetic entities with sequence divergences ranging from 7.8 to 14% (mtDNA) and 5 to 32% (ncDNA), respectively. _	1
Phylogenetic patterns strongly suggest historic speciation events and the reconstruction of at least 7 different species within Aurelia. _	1
Both genetic divergences and life history traits showed associations to environmental factors, suggesting ecological differentiation forced by divergent selection. @	1
Hybridization and introgression between Aurelia lineages likely occurred due to secondary contacts, which, however, did not disrupt the unambiguousness of genetic separation.ConclusionsOur findings recommend Aurelia as a model system for using the combined power of organismic, ecological, and molecular data to unravel speciation processes in cosmopolitan marine organisms. @	1
BackgroundThe cosmopolitan moon jelly Aurelia is characterized by high degrees of morphological and ecological plasticity, and subsequently by an unclear taxonomic status. `	0
The latter has been revised repeatedly over the last century, dividing the genus Aurelia in as many as 12 or as little as two species. `	0
Here we resolve these paradoxical findings and show that the capacity of LYVE-1 to bind HA is strictly dependent on avidity, demanding appropriate receptor self-association and/or HA multimerization. _	1
In particular, we demonstrate the prerequisite of a critical LYVE-1 threshold density and show that HA binding may be elicited in lymphatic endothelium by surface clustering with divalent LYVE-1 mAbs. @	1
In addition, we show that cross-linking of biotinylated HA in streptavidin multimers or supramolecular complexes with the inflammation-induced protein TSG-6 enables binding even in the absence of LYVE-1 cross-linking. @	1
Finally, we show that endogenous HA on the surface of macrophages can engage LYVE-1, facilitating their adhesion and transit across lymphatic endothelium. @	1
These results reveal LYVE-1 as a low affinity receptor tuned to discriminate between different HA configurations through avidity and establish a new mechanistic basis for the functions ascribed to LYVE-1 in matrix HA binding and leukocyte traffickingin vivo. @	1
The lymphatic endothelial receptor LYVE-1 has been implicated in both uptake of hyaluronan (HA) from tissue matrix and in facilitating transit of leukocytes and tumor cells through lymphatic vessels based largely onin vitrostudies with recombinant receptor in transfected fibroblasts. `	0
Curiously, however, LYVE-1 in lymphatic endothelium displays little if any binding to HAin vitro, and this has led to the conclusion that the native receptor is functionally silenced, a feature that is difficult to reconcile with its proposedin vivofunctions. `	0
Nonetheless, as we reported recently, LYVE-1 can function as a receptor for HA-encapsulated Group A streptococci and mediate lymphatic dissemination in mice. _	0
An inductive approach was used to develop probabilistic resource selection models using logistic regression to quantify the likelihood of hogs being in any area of the Department of Energy’s 805 km 2 Savannah River Site (SRS) in west-central South Carolina. `	1
The model’s significant parameters indicated that wild hogs preferred hardwoods and avoided pine and shrubby areas. _	1
Further, landscape metric analyses revealed that hogs preferred areas with large complex patch areas and low size variation. _	1
These resource selection models were then utilized to better estimate exposure of wild hogs to radionuclides and metals in a disturbed riparian ecosystem on the SRS using two different possible diets based on food availability. @	1
Contaminant exposure can be better estimated using these resource selection models than has been previously possible, because past practices did not consider home range and habitat utilization probability in heterogeneously contaminated habitats. @	1
In North America, wild hogs (Sus scrofa) are both sought after as prime game and despised due to their detrimental impacts to the environment from their digging and rooting behavior. `	0
They are also a potentially useful indicator species for environmental health for both ecological- and human-based risk assessments. `	0
These models were derived by using available SRS hog hunt data from 1993‐2000 and a Geographic Information System database describing the habitat structure of the SRS. _	0
Had these models not been used, risk calculations would assume that contaminated areas were utilized 100% of the time, thus overestimating exposure by a factor of up to 25. @	0
The results of the present study suggest that overexpression of H19 is associated with decreased recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates in patients with colorectal cancer, and increased viability and migration in colon cancer cells. @	1
Long non-coding RNA-imprinted maternally expressed transcript (non-protein coding) (H19) has been previously identified to be involved in the development of a number of types of cancer. `	0
However, the function of H19 in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer remains unclear. `	0
The expression level of H19 in colorectal tumor tissues, and the association between H19 expression and clinicopathological variables and prognosis was investigated in the present study. _	0
In addition, the effect of H19 overexpression on viability, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colon cancer cells was investigated in HCT-116 and SW-480 cells. _	0
The induction of the EMT process may be an underlying molecular mechanism associated with the H19-induced increased metastasis potential of colon cancer cells. @	0
To examine the requirements and outcomes of combined activation, we stimulated TLRs and a specific NLR, nucleotide binding and oligomerization, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), simultaneously and discovered that such activation triggers rapid caspase-1 cleavage, leading to secretion of presynthesized inflammatory molecules and pyroptosis. _	1
This acute caspase-1 activation is independent of new protein synthesis and depends on the TLR-signaling molecule IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1) and its kinase activity. @	1
Importantly, Listeria monocytogenes induces NLRP3-dependent rapid caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis, both of which are compromised in IRAK-1-deficient macrophages. @	1
Our results reveal that simultaneous sensing of microbial ligands and virulence factors by TLRs and NLRP3, respectively, leads to a rapid TLR- and IRAK-1-dependent assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and that such activation is important for release of alarmins, pyroptosis, and early IFN-γ production by memory CD8 T cells, all of which could be critical for early host defense. @	1
Pathogenic infections and tissue injuries trigger the assembly of inflammasomes, cytosolic protein complexes that activate caspase-1, leading to cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 and to pyroptosis, a proinflammatory cell death program. `	0
Although microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is known to induce the synthesis of the major caspase-1 substrate pro-IL-1β, the role of TLRs has been considered limited to up-regulation of the inflammasome components. `	0
During infection with a virulent microbe, TLRs and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) are likely activated simultaneously. _	0
The aim of this review is to present an overview of the roles of adipokines in different immune and nonimmune cells, which will contribute to diabetes as well as to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance development. @	1
We describe how adipokines regulate inflammation in these diseases and their therapeutic implications. @	1
We also survey current attempts to exploit adipokines for clinical applications, which hold potential as novel approaches to drug development in several immune-mediated diseases. @	1
Diabetes and obesity are worldwide health problems. `	0
White fat dynamically participates in hormonal and inflammatory regulation. `	0
White adipose tissue is recognized as a multifactorial organ that secretes several adipose-derived factors that have been collectively termed "adipokines." `	0
Adipokines are pleiotropic molecules that gather factors such as leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, apelin, vaspin, hepcidin, RBP4, and inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1β, among others. _	0
Multiple roles in metabolic and inflammatory responses have been assigned to these molecules. _	0
Several adipokines contribute to the self-styled "low-grade inflammatory state" of obese and insulin-resistant subjects, inducing the accumulation of metabolic anomalies within these individuals, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. _	0
Thus, adipokines are an interesting drug target to treat autoimmune diseases, obesity, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue inflammation. @	0
Statistical analyses were performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test, with parameters significant at P < 0·05. _	1
Increased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-17 and IL-23 were significant in patients with TAO when compared to the controls (P < 0·005, all parameters). @	1
The results presented here indicate an increased production of cytokines in TAO, possibly contributing to the inflammatory response observed in the patients' vascular levels. @	1
In addition, the increased levels of IL-17 and IL-23 suggest that the disturbance of TAO is involved with mechanisms of autoimmunity. @	1
Thus, the discovery of IL-17 and its association with inflammation and autoimmune pathology has reshaped our viewpoint regarding the pathogenesis of TAO, which was based previously on the T helper type 1 (Th1)-Th2 paradigm. @	1
Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a segmental inflammatory occlusive disorder that affects the arm and leg arteries of young smokers. `	0
The immune system seems to play a critical role in the aetiology of TAO; however, knowledge of the aspects involved in the progression of vascular tissue inflammation and, consequently, the evolution of this disease is still limited. `	0
This study was carried out to investigate the cytokine levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-17 and IL-23 in the plasma of TAO patients presenting with acute clinical manifestations. `	0
The study included 20 TAO patients (n = 10 women; n = 10 men) aged 38-59 years under clinical follow-up, classified into two groups: (i) TAO former smokers (n = 11) and (ii) TAO active smokers (n = 9); the control groups included normal volunteer non-smokers (n = 10, active smokers (n = 10) and former smokers (n = 10). _	0
Patients' plasma samples were measured using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. _	0
The activities of all cytokines were different in groups of TAO patients when compared with normal controls, and decreased for control smokers. @	0
In the ESRD patients plasma phosphate demonstrated significant circadian variation (P < 0.00001). _	1
The peak occurred around 3:30 am and nadir occurred around 11:00 am. @	1
Ionized calcium (P = 0.0036), PTH (P = 0.0004) and 25OHD (P = 0.009) also varied significantly during the circadian period; for ionized calcium peak and nadir occurred around 12:15 pm and 8:00 pm, parathyroid hormone 5:45 pm and 10:15 am, and 25OHD 9:45 am and 4:00 pm respectively. @	1
FGF-23 did not show a significant circadian variation. @	1
Only phosphate (P < 0.0001) and PTH (P = 0.00008) demonstrated circadian variation in the control group. @	1
Blood concentrations of phosphate, calcium, PTH and 25-hydroxy vitamin D, exhibit a circadian variation in patients with ESRD. @	1
Knowledge of these phenomena is pertinent for the interpretation of clinical testing. @	1
Mineral and bone parameters are actively managed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). `	0
However, whether these undergo circadian variation is not known. `	0
We investigated the circadian variation of mineral and bone parameters in patients on long-term hemodialysis. `	0
Seventeen ESRD patients on long-term hemodialysis and eight volunteers without kidney disease were enrolled. `	0
Subjects had all medications that affect calcium–phosphate–parathyroid hormone balance (phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, and calcimimetics) discontinued. _	0
Thereafter, for a period of 5 days, subjects consumed a diet controlled in calcium (1,200 mg per day) and phosphorus (1,000 mg per day) content. _	0
On the sixth day (a non-dialysis day for the ESRD patients), enrollees underwent twelve 2-h blood draws for phosphate, ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), total 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD), and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). _	0
In this paper we show that there are no such ambiguities, we also update the model, making it amenable to possible new applications. @	1
In quantum theory it is possible to explain time, and dynamics, in terms of entanglement. `	0
This is the timeless approach to time, which assumes that the universe is in a stationary state, where two non-interacting subsystems, the clock and the rest, are entangled. _	0
As a consequence, by choosing a suitable observable of the clock, the relative state of the rest of the universe evolves unitarily with respect to the variable labelling the clock observable's eigenstates, which is then interpreted as time. @	0
This model for an evolution without evolution (Page and Wootters, 1983), albeit elegant, has never been developed further, because it was criticised for generating severe ambiguities in the dynamics of the rest of the universe. @	0
Here we show that the Drosocrystallin (Dcy) protein, a putative component of the eye lens of Drosophila, contributes to adult PM formation. _	1
A loss-of-function mutation in the dcy gene results in a reduction of PM width and an increase of its permeability. _	1
Upon bacterial ingestion a higher level of expression of antibacterial peptides was observed in dcy mutants, pointing to an influence of this matrix on bacteria sensing by the Imd immune pathway. _	1
Moreover, dcy-deficient flies show an increased susceptibility to oral infections with the entomopathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas entomophila and Serratia marcescens. @	1
Dcy mutant flies also succumb faster than wild type upon ingestion of a P. entomophila toxic extract. @	1
We show that this lethality is due in part to an increased deleterious action of Monalysin, a pore-forming toxin produced by P. entomophila. @	1
Collectively, our analysis of the dcy immune phenotype indicates that the PM plays an important role in Drosophila host defense against enteric pathogens, preventing the damaging action of pore-forming toxins on intestinal cells. @	1
The peritrophic matrix (PM) forms a layer composed of chitin and glycoproteins that lines the insect intestinal lumen. `	0
This physical barrier plays a role analogous to that of mucous secretions of the vertebrate digestive tract and is thought to protect the midgut epithelium from abrasive food particles and microbes. `	0
Almost nothing is known about PM functions in Drosophila, and its function as an immune barrier has never been addressed by a genetic approach. `	0
RESULTS In this paper, we investigated the consistency of biomarker identification using differentially expressed (DE) peaks from peak profiles produced by three widely used average spectrum-dependent pre-processing algorithms based on SELDI-TOF MS data for prostate and breast cancers. _	1
Our results revealed two important factors that affect the consistency of DE peak identification using different algorithms. _	1
One factor is that some DE peaks selected from one peak profile were not detected as peaks in other profiles, and the second factor is that the statistical power of identifying DE peaks in large peak profiles with many peaks may be low due to the large scale of the tests and small number of samples. @	1
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the DE peak detection power in large profiles could be improved by the stratified false discovery rate (FDR) control approach and that the reproducibility of DE peak detection could thereby be increased. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Comparing and evaluating pre-processing algorithms in terms of reproducibility can elucidate the relationship among different algorithms and also help in selecting a pre-processing algorithm. @	1
The DE peaks selected from small peak profiles with few peaks for a dataset tend to be reproducibly detected in large peak profiles, which suggests that a suitable pre-processing algorithm should be able to produce peaks sufficient for identifying useful and reproducible biomarkers. @	1
BACKGROUND There has been much interest in differentiating diseased and normal samples using biomarkers derived from mass spectrometry (MS) studies. `	0
However, biomarker identification for specific diseases has been hindered by irreproducibility. `	0
Specifically, a peak profile extracted from a dataset for biomarker identification depends on a data pre-processing algorithm. `	0
Until now, no widely accepted agreement has been reached. _	0
This work revisits the notochord signaling contribution to temporal control of PSM segmentation by assessing the rate and number of somites formed and somitogenesis molecular clock gene expression oscillations upon notochord ablation. `	1
We have characterized chick smoothened expression pattern and have found that the PSM expresses both patched1 and smoothened Shh signal transducers. _	1
Strikingly, notochord-deprived PSM segmentation rate recovers over time, concomitant with raldh2 overexpression. @	1
Accordingly, exogenous RA supplement rescues notochord ablation effects on somite formation. @	1
Altogether, our data provide evidence that a balance between different pathways ensures the robustness of timely somite formation and that notochord-derived Shh is a component of the molecular network regulating the pace of the somitogenesis clock. @	1
Vertebrate embryo somite formation is temporally controlled by the cyclic expression of somitogenesis clock genes in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). `	0
The somitogenesis clock is believed to be an intrinsic property of this tissue, operating independently of embryonic midline structures and the signaling molecules produced therein, namely Sonic hedgehog (Shh). `	0
The absence of the notochord causes a delay in somite formation, accompanied by an increase in the period of molecular clock oscillations. _	0
Shh is the notochord-derived signal responsible for this effect, as these alterations are recapitulated by Shh signaling inhibitors and rescued by an external Shh supply. _	0
Upon notochord ablation, patched1, gli1, and fgf8 are down-regulated, whereas gli2 and gli3 are overexpressed. @	0
A model is presented in which Shh and RA pathways converge to inhibit PSM Gli activity, ensuring timely somite formation. @	0
In this study, we analytically evaluate the effects of changing the radial conductance between the xylem and the phloem on phloem diameter variations and test the theory using simple manipulation experiments. _	1
Our results show that phloem diameter variations are mainly caused by changes in the radial flow rate of water between the xylem and the phloem. _	1
Reducing the hydraulic conductance between these tissues decreases the amplitude of phloem diameter variation and increases the time lag between xylem and phloem diameter variation in a predictable manner. @	1
Measurements of diurnal diameter variations of the xylem and phloem are a promising tool for studying plant hydraulics and xylem-phloem interactions in field conditions. `	0
However, both the theoretical framework and the experimental verification needed to interpret phloem diameter data are incomplete. `	0
Variation in the amplitude and timing of diameter variations that cannot be explained by changes in the hydraulic conductance, could be related to changes in the osmotic concentration in the phloem. @	0
RESULTS Of 1008 randomized patients, the odds of experiencing grade ≥ 3 ATE were significantly greater in those who received bevacizumab compared with those who received placebo (odds ratio, 2.79; P = .02), whereas an opposite trend was noted for grade ≥ 3 VTE (odds ratio, 0.60; P = .08). @	1
In the multivariable analysis, bevacizumab treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 3.00; P = .01) and age (HR, 1.06; P = .02) were significantly associated with the risk of ATE; whereas age (HR, 1.05; P = .01) and VTE risk score (HR, 1.83; P = .03) were significantly associated with the risk of VTE. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Bevacizumab was significantly associated with a greater risk of ATE in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, but it was not significantly associated with the risk of VTE. @	1
BACKGROUND Bevacizumab is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE); however, its effect on venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains controversial. `	0
Scant data exist on the factors that increase the risk of ATE/VTE in patients with prostate cancer. `	0
The authors investigated the association of bevacizumab treatment and clinical factors with ATE/VTE risk in patients who were treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial 90401. `	0
METHODS Patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomized to receive docetaxel and prednisone with or without bevacizumab once every 21 days. _	0
Cycle-to-event Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of bevacizumab with the incidence of grade 3 or greater (≥ 3) ATE and VTE. _	0
Age, prior ATE/VTE, baseline antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and VTE risk score (based on leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, body mass index, and tumor location) were evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses. _	0
Understanding clinical factors that increase the risk for experiencing ATE/VTE is essential to mitigate the risks and reduce the burden of these prevalent complications in cancer care. @	0
In the present study, the cytological and ultrastructural alterations triggered by two treatments that improve androgenic induction, n-butanol (0.2 % n-butanol for 6 h) and cold pretreatment (7 °C for 10 days) were studied in maize anther cultures. `	1
Both treatments increased the frequency of responding microspores, and the highest embryo yield (20.9 embryos per 100 plated anthers compared to 0.5/100 anthers in control) was achieved when a combination of both treatments was applied. _	1
To study the effect of the treatments on the cytoskeleton, we labeled microtubules using indirect immunofluorescence and actin filaments by rhodamine phalloidin. _	1
Cold pretreatment increased the quantity of actin filaments, whereas the microtubule network remained unaffected. _	1
In contrast, n-butanol treatment triggered the reversible depolymerization of microtubules, without having any effect on the actin network. @	1
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that n-butanol induced the formation of irregular cell walls. @	1
Autophagy-related structures were present during the early development of embryogenic microspores following both treatments, but autophagy was only sustained after fourteen days in microspore-derived structures treated with n-butanol. @	1
The results support the concept that the androgenic developmental switch is assisted by cytoskeletal rearrangements, which may facilitate androgenic induction through the promotion of symmetric divisions. @	1
The improvement of androgenic induction efficiency of anther cultures is an important goal for plant biotechnology. `	0
Although n-butanol has been proven to enhance the androgenic induction, the structural background of this effect has not been investigated in detail. `	0
The longer duration of autophagic processes may also play a role in the elevated embryo induction after n-butanol treatment. @	0
We evaluated whether object-based attention might involve pattern-specific feedback to early visual areas to selectively enhance the set of low-level features corresponding to the attended object. `	1
Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis, we found that activity patterns in early visual areas (V1-V4) are strongly biased in favor of the attended object. _	1
Activity patterns evoked by single faces and single houses reliably predicted which of the 2 overlapping stimulus types was being attended with high accuracy (80-90% correct). _	1
Superior knowledge of upright objects led to improved attentional selection in early areas. @	1
Across individual blocks, the strength of the attentional bias signal in early visual areas was highly predictive of the modulations found in high-level object areas, implying that pattern-specific attentional filtering at early sites can determine the quality of object-specific signals that reach higher level visual areas. @	1
Through computational modeling, we show how feedback of an average template to V1-like units can improve discrimination of exemplars belonging to the attended category. @	1
Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how feedback to early visual areas can contribute to the attentional selection of complex objects. @	1
What neural mechanisms underlie the ability to attend to a complex object in the presence of competing overlapping stimuli? `	0
To identify the targets of these retinopetal axons, we localized histamine receptors (HR) in monkey and rat retinas by light and electron microscopy. `	1
In monkeys, puncta containing HR3 were found at the tips of ON-bipolar cell dendrites in cone pedicles and rod spherules, closer to the photoreceptors than the other neurotransmitter receptors. _	1
This is the first ultrastructural localization of any histamine receptor and the first direct evidence that HR3 is present on postsynaptic membranes in the central nervous system. _	1
In rat retinas, most HR1 were localized to dopaminergic amacrine cells. @	1
Mammalian retinas are innervated by histaminergic axons that originate from perikarya in the posterior hypothalamus. `	0
The differences in histamine receptor localization may reflect the differences in the activity patterns of the two species. @	0
RESULTS Incorporating the functional divergence of template and copy into the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System model framework we show that sequence complementarity 1) does not ruin the coexistence of a set of metabolically cooperating replicators; 2) the replicator system remains resistant to, but also tolerant with its parasites; 3) opens the way to the evolutionary differentiation of phenotype and genotype through a primitive version of phenotype amplification. @	1
CONCLUSIONS The functional asymmetry of complementary RNA strains results in a shift of phenotype/genotype (enzyme/gene) proportions in MCRS, favouring a slight genotype dominance. @	1
This asymmetry is expected to reverse due to the evolved trade-off of high "gene" replicability and high catalytic activity of the corresponding "enzyme" in expense of its replicability. @	1
This trade-off is the first evolutionary step towards the "division of labour" among enzymes and genes, which has concluded in the extreme form of phenotype amplification characteristic of our recent DNA-RNA-protein World. @	1
BACKGROUND RNA or RNA-like polymers are the most likely candidates for having played the lead roles on the stage of the origin of life. `	0
RNA is known to feature two of the three essential functions of living entities (metabolism, heredity and membrane): it is capable of unlimited heredity and it has a proven capacity for catalysing very different chemical reactions which may form simple metabolic networks. `	0
The Metabolically Coupled Replicator System is a class of simulation models built on these two functions to show that an RNA World scenario for the origin of life is ecologically feasible, provided that it is played on mineral surfaces. _	0
The fact that RNA templates and their copies are of complementary base sequences has an obvious dynamical relevance: complementary strains may have very different structures and, consequently, functions - one may specialize for increasing enzymatic activity while the other takes the role of the gene of the enzyme. _	0
We linearize the Einstein-scalar field equations, expressed relative to constant mean curvature (CMC)-transported spatial coordinates gauge, around members of the well-known family of Kasner solutions on $(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{T}^3$. `	1
We place initial data for the linearized system along $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace \simeq \mathbb{T}^3$ and study the linear solution's behavior in the collapsing direction $t \downarrow 0$. _	1
Our first main result is the proof of an approximate $L^2$ monotonicity identity for the linear solutions. _	1
Using it, we prove a linear stability result that holds when the background Kasner solution is sufficiently close to the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solution. @	1
In particular, we show that as $t \downarrow 0$, various time-rescaled components of the linear solution converge to regular functions defined along $\lbrace t = 0 \rbrace$. @	1
In addition, we motivate the preferred direction of the approximate monotonicity by showing that the CMC-transported spatial coordinates gauge can be viewed as a limiting version of a family of parabolic gauges for the lapse variable; an approximate monotonicity identity and corresponding linear stability results also hold in the parabolic gauges, but the corresponding parabolic PDEs are locally well-posed only in the direction $t \downarrow 0$. @	1
Finally, based on the linear stability results, we outline a proof of the following result, whose complete proof will appear elsewhere: the FLRW solution is globally nonlinearly stable in the collapsing direction $t \downarrow 0$ under small perturbations of its data at $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace$. @	1
The Kasner solutions model a spatially uniform scalar field evolving in a (typically) spatially anisotropic spacetime that expands towards the future and that has a"Big Bang"singularity at $\lbrace t = 0 \rbrace$. `	0
98% women reported to have taken at least one medication during pregnancy, mainly those used in antenatal programmes. _	1
Other most reported drugs were analgesics (24%), antibiotics (17%), and antimalarial (15%), excluding IPTp. _	1
Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was the most used antimalarial for treating illness by nearly 3/4 compared to other groups of malaria drugs. _	1
Overall, antimalarial and antibiotic exposures in pregnancy were not significantly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. @	1
Iron and folic acid supplementation were associated with decreased risk of miscarriage/stillbirth (OR 0.1; 0.08-0.3). @	1
CONCLUSION Almost all women were exposed to medication during pregnancy. @	1
Exposure to iron and folic acid had a beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome. @	1
HDSS proved to be a useful platform to establish a reliable pharmacovigilance system in resource-limited countries. @	1
BACKGROUND There is limited safety information on most drugs used during pregnancy. `	0
This is especially true for medication against tropical diseases because pharmacovigilance systems are not much developed in these settings. `	0
The aim of the present study was to demonstrate feasibility of using Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) as a platform to monitor drug safety in pregnancy. `	0
METHODS Pregnant women with gestational age below 20 weeks were recruited from Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) clinics or from monthly house visits carried out for the HDSS. `	0
A structured questionnaire was used to interview pregnant women. `	0
Participants were followed on monthly basis to record any new drug used as well as pregnancy outcome. _	0
RESULTS 1089 pregnant women were recruited; 994 (91.3%) completed the follow-up until delivery. _	0
Widening drug safety information is essential to facilitate evidence based risk-benefit decision for treatment during pregnancy, a major challenge with newly marketed medicines. @	0
In this paper, we present a machine-learning based crowdworker filtering technique that can be used to assess workers immediately after they finish their assigned tasks. _	1
A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based crowdworker filter, called a Smart Crowd Filter (SCFilter), was used to predict the probability that each label is correct and identifies those crowdworkers that consistently provide answers that are unlikely to be correct. _	1
To verify the performance of the SCFilter, a bad worker detection simulation test and an experiment in an actual crowdsourcing environment at the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) website were performed. @	1
In the experiment at the AMT website, a statistically significant improvement was observed for automatic document classification. @	1
ABSTRACTCrowdsourcing has been recognized as a possible technique to complement costly user studies, usability studies, relevance judgment for information retrieval studies, and training set build-up for automatic document classification. `	0
However, the quality of crowdworkers varies by diverse factors and we often cannot tell whether their answers are right or wrong immediately due to the lack of gold standard answers. `	0
In the simulation test, bad worker detection performance was assessed in terms of precision and recall. @	0
This paper addresses two major challenges in the field of climate change impact analysis on water resources systems: i) incorporation of a large range of potential climate change scenarios and ii) quantification of related modelling uncertainties. `	1
The developed methodology of climate change impact modelling is presented and illustrated through an application to a hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps that uses the discharge of a highly glacierized catchment. `	1
The obtained results for both periods lead to the conclusion that potential climate change has as statistically significant negative impact on the system performance. @	1
The potential climate change impacts are analysed in terms of system performance for the control period (1961 – 1990) and for the future period (2070 – 2099) under a range of climate change scenarios. _	0
The system performance is simulated through a set of 4 model types including the production of regional climate change scenarios based on global-mean warming scenarios, the corresponding discharge model, the model of glacier surface evolution and the hydropower management model. _	0
The modelling uncertainties inherent to each model type are characterised and quantified separately. @	0
The overall modelling uncertainty is simulated through Monte Carlo simulations of the system behaviour for the control and the future period. @	0
We describe a simplified method for extracting androgens from avian egg yolks. _	1
Our method, which has been validated through recovery and linearity experiments, consists of a single ethanol precipitation that produces substantially higher recoveries than those reported by Schwabl (1993. _	1
Female birds deposit significant amounts of steroid hormones into the yolks of their eggs. `	0
Studies have demonstrated that these hormones, particularly androgens, affect nestling growth and development. `	0
In order to measure androgen concentrations in avian egg yolks, most authors follow the extraction methods outlined by Schwabl (1993. `	0

To understand how RNAs fold uniquely despite a small number of tertiary interaction motifs, we mutated the major tertiary interactions in a group I ribozyme by single-base substitutions. `	1
Double- and triple-mutant cycles show that most tertiary interactions have a small effect on the stability of the native state. _	1
Instead, the formation of core and peripheral structural motifs is cooperatively linked in near-native folding intermediates, and this cooperativity depends on the native helix orientation. @	1
The emergence of a cooperative interaction network at an early stage of folding suppresses nonnative structures and guides the search for the native state. @	1
Noncoding RNAs form unique 3D structures, which perform many regulatory functions. `	0
The resulting perturbations to the folding energy landscape were measured using SAXS, ribozyme activity, hydroxyl radical footprinting, and native PAGE. _	0
We suggest that cooperativity in noncoding RNAs arose from natural selection of architectures conducive to forming a unique, stable fold. @	0
CONCLUSION According to the current published literature, whole-lung lavage with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support is a very rare treatment method. @	1
Even when taking into account all of the risks associated with whole-lung lavage and v-v extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, we found that this technique is very effective and, without a doubt, it saved the life of our patient. @	1
BACKGROUD Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare disorder that is characterized by a large accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli. `	0
This causes respiratory failure due to a restriction of gas exchange and changes in the ventilation/perfusion ratio. `	0
Clinical symptoms are variable and depend on the severity of damage of the lung parenchyma. `	0
Treatment method is whole-lung lavage, where the accumulated lipoproteinaceous material is removed using large quantities of saline. _	0
CASE PRESENTATION This case report describes a 45 year old patient with advanced pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. _	0
Due to the presence of severe global respiratory insufficiency, this patient could not undergo the classic whole-lung lavage using a double-lumen tube and selective lung ventilation. _	0
The whole-lung lavage was performed with the support of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. @	0
A total of 27 l of warm saline was used. @	0
This article presents a computational model for simulating the interaction between cyclones. `	1
The proposed numerical method is presented briefly, where the time integration is performed by projecting the discrete system onto a Krylov subspace. _	1
The method filters the large scale fluid dynamics using a multiresolution approximation, and the unresolved dynamics is modeled with a Smagorinsky type subgrid scale parameterization scheme. _	1
An excellent agreement between the present simulation and a reference simulation at Re = 5000 has been demonstrated. @	1
At Re = 37440, the kinetic energy of cyclones is seen consolidated into larger scales with concurrent enstrophy cascade, suggesting a steady increase of energy containing scales, a phenomena that is typical in two-dimensional turbulence theory. @	1
The primary results of this article suggest a novel avenue for addressing some of the computational challenges of mesoscale atmospheric circulations. @	1
The fundamental interaction between tropical cyclones was investigated through a series of water tank experiements by Fujiwhara [20, 21, 22]. `	0
However, a complete understanding of tropical cyclones remains an open research challenge although there have been numerous investigations through measurments with aircrafts/satellites, as well as with numerical simulations. `	0
Numerical experiments with Fujiwhara interactions are considered to verify modeling accuracy. _	0
We provide general conditions guaranteeing the weak ergodic convergence of each trajectory $x(\cdot)$ to a zero of a limit maximal monotone operator $ A_\infty$, as the time variable $t$ tends to $+\infty$. `	1
The crucial point is to use the Br\'ezis-Haraux function, or equivalently the Fitzpatrick function, to express at which rate the excess of $\gph A_\infty$ over $\gph A_t$ tends to zero. _	1
In the case of operators $A_t= \partial \phi_t$ which are subdifferentials of closed convex functions $\phi_t$, we show convergence results for the trajectories. @	1
Then, we specialize our results to multiscale evolution equations, and obtain asymptotic properties of hierarchical minimization, and selection of viscosity solutions. @	1
In a Hilbert setting $H$, we study the asymptotic behavior of the trajectories of nonautonomous evolution equations $\dot x(t)+A_t(x(t))\ni 0$, where for each $t\geq 0$, $A_t:H\tto H$ denotes a maximal monotone operator. `	0
This approach gives a sharp and unifying view on this subject. _	0

In the present study, TTSuV1 (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b prevalence was evaluated in 721 serum samples of healthy pigs from Sardinian farms, insular Italy. _	1
This is the largest study to date on the presence of TTSuV in healthy pigs in Italy. _	1
The global prevalence of infection was 83.2% (600/721), being 62.3% (449/721), 60.6% (437/721), and 11.5% (83/721) the prevalence of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b, respectively. _	1
The rate of co-infection with two and/or three species was also calculated, and data show that co-infections were significantly more frequent than infections with single species, and that TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a double infection was the prevalent combination (35.4%). @	1
Quantitative results obtained using species-specific real time-qPCR evidenced the highest mean levels of viremia in the TTSuV1 subgroup, and the lowest in the TTSuVk2b subgroup. @	1
Interestingly, multiple infections with distinct TTSuV species seemed to significantly affect the DNA load and specifically, data highlighted that double infection with TTSuVk2a increased the viral titers of TTSuV1, likewise the co-infection with TTSuVk2b increased the titers of TTSuVk2a. @	1
Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a large group of vertebrate-infecting small viruses with circular single-stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. `	0
In swine, two genetically distinct species, Torque teno sus virus 1a (TTSuV1a) and 1b (TTSuV1b) are currently grouped into the genus Iotatorquevirus. `	0
More recently, a novel Torque teno sus virus species, named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), has been included with Torque teno sus virus k2a (TTSuVk2a) into the genus Kappatorquevirus. `	0
To determine the impact of the refactoring of JabRef, we measure the code churn and code ownership before and after the refactoring and find that large files with violations had a significantly higher code churn than large files without violations before the refactoring. _	1
After the refactoring, the files that had violations show a more normal code churn. @	1
We find no such effect on code ownership. @	1
We conclude that files that contain violations detectable by SACC methods are connected to higher than normal code churn. @	1
The open source application JabRef has existed since 2003. `	0
In 2015, the developers decided to make an architectural refactoring as continued development was deemed too demanding. `	0
The developers also introduced Static Architecture Conformance Checking (SACC) to prevent violations to the intended architecture. `	0
Measurements mined from source code repositories such as code churn and code ownership has been linked to several problems, for example fault proneness, security vulnerabilities, code smells, and degraded maintainability. _	0
The root cause of such problems can be architectural. _	0
Using the MCF-10A-series of cell lines that recapitulate the early stages of breast cancer formation and EMT, we found TWIST1 to be upregulated during EMT and downregulated early in carcinogenesis. @	1
The TWIST1 3′UTR contains putative regulatory elements, including miRNA target sites and two cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE). @	1
We found that miR-580, CPEB1, and CPEB2 act as negative regulators of TWIST1 expression in a sequence-specific and additive/cooperative manner. @	1
TWIST1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). `	0
Its misregulation has been observed in various types of tumors. _	0
Recently, we have identified a novel autophagic inducer, saikosaponin-d (Ssd), from a medicinal plant that induces autophagy in various types of cancer cells through the formation of autophagosomes as measured by GFP-LC3 puncta formation. _	1
By computational virtual docking analysis, biochemical assays and advanced live-cell imaging techniques, Ssd was shown to increase cytosolic calcium level via direct inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase pump, leading to autophagy induction through the activation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-AMP-activated protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. @	1
In addition, Ssd treatment causes the disruption of calcium homeostasis, which induces endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as the unfolded protein responses pathway. @	1
Ssd also proved to be a potent cytotoxic agent in apoptosis-defective or apoptosis-resistant mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, which either lack caspases 3, 7 or 8 or had the Bax-Bak double knockout. @	1
These results provide a detailed understanding of the mechanism of action of Ssd, as a novel autophagic inducer, which has the potential of being developed into an anti-cancer agent for targeting apoptosis-resistant cancer cells. @	1
Autophagy is an important cellular process that controls cells in a normal homeostatic state by recycling nutrients to maintain cellular energy levels for cell survival via the turnover of proteins and damaged organelles. `	0
However, persistent activation of autophagy can lead to excessive depletion of cellular organelles and essential proteins, leading to caspase-independent autophagic cell death. `	0
As such, inducing cell death through this autophagic mechanism could be an alternative approach to the treatment of cancers. _	0
The organism belongs to the genus Micropolyspora Lechevalier et al. _	1
and is described as a new species Micropolyspora faeni. @	1
SUMMARY: Taxonomic studies on the thermophilic oligosporic actinomycete chiefly responsible for the respiratory disease Farmer's Lung support the view that the organism was incorrectly identified as Thermopolyspora polyspora Hens. `	0
Building on research suggesting that individuals' social preferences might be a common factor informing both behaviors, we study the impact of a set of different motives on individuals' choices in a dual-role Trust Game (TG). `	1
Subjects' social motives were inferred using their decisions in a Dictator Game and a dual-role Ultimatum Game. _	1
Next to self-interest and strategic motives we consider preferences for altruism, spitefulness, egalitarianism, and efficiency. _	1
We demonstrate that there exists considerable heterogeneity in motives in the TG. @	1
Most importantly, among individuals who choose to trust as trustors, social motives can differ dramatically as there is a non-negligible proportion of them who seem to act out of (strategic) self-interest whereas others are driven more by efficiency considerations. @	1
Subjects' elicited trustworthiness, however, can be used to infer such motivations: while the former are not trustworthy as trustees, the latter are. @	1
We discuss that research on trust can benefit from adding the second player's choice in TG designs. @	1
Trustful and trustworthy behaviors have important externalities for the society. `	0
But what exactly drives people to behave in a trustful and trustworthy manner? `	0
We employ data from a large-scale representative experiment (N = 774), where all subjects played both roles of a binary TG with real monetary incentives. _	0
We report the crystal structures of the TRAF domain of TRAF5 and that of TRAF3 bound to a peptide from the TRAF-interacting motif of Cardif. _	1
By comparing these structures, we identified two residues located near the Cardif binding pocket in TRAF3 (Tyr(440) and Phe(473)) that potentially contributed to Cardif recognition. _	1
In vitro and cellular experiments showed that forms of TRAF5 with mutation of the corresponding residues to those of TRAF3 had TRAF3-like antiviral activity. @	1
Our results provide a structural basis for the critical role of TRAF3 in activating RIG-I-mediated IFN production. @	1
The TRAF [tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor] family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins link cell-surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways that regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. `	0
In response to activation of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), a component of a pattern recognition receptor that detects viruses, TRAF3 binds to the adaptor protein Cardif [caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) adaptor-inducing interferon-β (IFN-β)], leading to induction of type I IFNs. `	0
We study the propagators of ghost and gluon fields in the Landau gauge to compute the running coupling in the MiniMom scheme. _	1
We analyze several different ensembles of lattice Monte Carlo simulations for the SU(2) adjoint QCD with Nf=1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 Dirac fermions. @	1
We show how the running of the coupling changes as the number of interacting fermions is increased towards the conformal window. @	1
Non-Abelian gauge theories with fermions transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group (AdjQCD) are a fundamental ingredient of many models that describe the physics beyond the Standard Model. `	0
Two relevant examples are N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and Minimal Walking Technicolor, which are gauge theories coupled to one adjoint Majorana and two adjoint Dirac fermions, respectively. `	0
While confinement is a property of N=1 SYM, Minimal Walking Technicolor is expected to be infrared conformal. _	0
We develop and generalize the theory of extreme value for non-stationary stochastic processes, mostly by weakening the uniform mixing condition that was previously used in this setting. `	1
We apply our results to non-autonomous dynamical systems, in particular to {\em sequential dynamical systems}, given by uniformly expanding maps, and to a few classes of random dynamical systems. _	1
Some examples are presented and worked out in detail. @	0
RESULTS For the Heerlen and Maastricht GP cooperative the annual contact rate, as extrapolated from our data, per 1000 inhabitants per year is 238 and 279 respectively (chi(2)((1df))=4.385, p=0.036). @	1
The contact rate at the A&E departments of Heerlen (n=66) and Maastricht (n=52) is not different (chi(2)((1df))=1.765, p=0.184). @	1
Some 51.7% of the patients attending the A&E department in Heerlen during out of hours were self referred, compared with 15.9% in Maastricht (chi(2)((1df))=203.13, p<0.001). @	1
CONCLUSIONS The organisation of out of hours care in Maastricht has optimised the GP's gatekeeper function and thereby led to fewer self referrals at the A&E department, compared with Heerlen. @	1
OBJECTIVES To investigate differences in numbers and characteristics of patients using primary or emergency care because of differences in organisation of out of hours care. `	0
BACKGROUND Increasing numbers of self referrals at the accident and emergency (A&E) department cause overcrowding, while a substantial number of these patients exhibit minor injuries that can be treated by a general practitioner (GP). `	0
METHODS Two different organisations of out of hours care in two Dutch cities (Heerlen and Maastricht) were investigated. `	0
Important differences between the two organisations are the accessibility and the location of primary care facility (GP cooperative). `	0
The Heerlen GP cooperative is situated in the centre of the city and is respectively 5 km and 9 km away from the two A&E departments situated in the area of Heerlen. _	0
This GP cooperative can only be visited by appointment. _	0
The Maastricht GP cooperative has free access and is located within the local A&E department. _	0
During a three week period all registration forms of patient contacts with out of hours care (GP cooperative and A&E department) were collected and with respect to the primary care patients a random sample of one third was analysed. _	0
We introduce a moment-based notion of dependence for functional time series which involves $m$-dependence. _	1
We show that it is applicable to linear as well as nonlinear functional time series. @	1
Then we investigate the impact of dependence thus quantified on several important statistical procedures for functional data. @	1
We study the estimation of the functional principal components, the long-run covariance matrix, change point detection and the functional linear model. @	1
We explain when temporal dependence affects the results obtained for i.i.d. @	1
functional observations and when these results are robust to weak dependence. @	1
Functional data often arise from measurements on fine time grids and are obtained by separating an almost continuous time record into natural consecutive intervals, for example, days. `	0
The functions thus obtained form a functional time series, and the central issue in the analysis of such data consists in taking into account the temporal dependence of these functional observations. `	0
Examples include daily curves of financial transaction data and daily patterns of geophysical and environmental data. `	0
For scalar and vector valued stochastic processes, a large number of dependence notions have been proposed, mostly involving mixing type distances between $\sigma$-algebras. _	0
In time series analysis, measures of dependence based on moments have proven most useful (autocovariances and cumulants). _	0
Patients who underwent LRYGB had a significantly better weight loss than patients with a rebanding operation (mean −6.1 versus +1.5 BMI points). _	1
In addition, the LRYGB patients showed a significantly better control of serum cholesterol during the long term follow-up (−0.6 versus +0.1 mmol/l). @	1
Almost half of the patients (45%) in the rebanding group needed a further operative revision, whereas only 20% underwent reoperation after rescue LRYGB. @	1
Thus, the secondary failure rate in the rebanding group was significantly higher compared to the bypass group (p = 0.028). @	1
The present long-term study confirms our previous finding that LRYGB is a better treatment than rebanding after failed laparoscopic gastric banding regarding weight loss and treatment of co-morbidities. @	1
During the long-term follow-up the reoperation rate due to secondary failure became significantly higher in the rebanding group. @	1
We therefore recommend that LRYGB should be preferred as rescue procedure after failed laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. @	1
Over the last decade, more than 130,000 laparoscopic adjustable gastric bandings (LAGB) have been performed for the treatment of morbid obesity. `	0
Nowadays, longer follow-up data are available in the literature and increasing numbers of late complications and treatment failures of gastric banding have been reported. `	0
The aim of the present study was the long-term evaluation of two different rescue operations after failed LAGB: conversion to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y bypass (LRYGB) versus laparoscopic gastric rebanding. `	0
Between January 1997 and November 2002, 74 consecutive patients underwent either laparoscopic gastric rebanding (n = 44) or LRYGB (n = 30) after failed LAGB. `	0
There were 14 men and 60 women, with a median age of 42 (23–60) years. `	0
The indication for reoperation was an increasing body mass index (BMI) and band-related complications such as pouch dilatation, band slippage, and penetration after LAGB. _	0
Rebandings were done by preference during the initial period of the study and LRYGB was the treatment of choice during the latter period. _	0
The success of the rescue operation was assessed by postoperative changes in the BMI, improvements of co-morbidities, and the need for further reoperations (secondary failure). _	0
The median follow-up was 36 months (range, 24–60 months). _	0
In this review, we summarize the recent literature to highlight the current status of this class of long non-coding lncRNAs in breast cancer. @	1
Breast cancer represents a major health burden in Europe and North America, as recently published data report breast cancer as the second leading cause of cancer related death in women worldwide. `	0
Breast cancer is regarded as a highly heterogeneous disease in terms of clinical course and biological behavior and can be divided into several molecular subtypes, with different prognosis and treatment responses. `	0
The discovery of numerous non-coding RNAs has dramatically changed our understanding of cell biology, especially the pathophysiology of cancer. _	0
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts >200 nucleotides in length. _	0
Several studies have demonstrated their role as key regulators of gene expression, cell biology and carcinogenesis. @	0
Deregulated expression levels of lncRNAs have been observed in various types of cancers including breast cancer. @	0
lncRNAs are involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastases. @	0
RESULTS  Antibody concentrations to AMA-1, EBA-175, and MSP-1(42) decreased with age during the first year of life, then increased to 32 months of age. _	1
Anti-MSP-3 antibody concentrations gradually increased, and GIA gradually decreased up to 32 months. _	1
Vaccination with RTS,S/AS01(E) resulted in modest reductions in AMA-1, EBA-175, MSP-1(42), and MSP-3 antibody concentrations and no significant change in GIA. _	1
Increasing anti-merozoite antibody concentrations and GIA were prospectively associated with increased risk of clinical malaria. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Vaccination with RTS,S/AS01E reduces exposure to blood-stage parasites and, thus, reduces anti-merozoite antigen antibody concentrations. @	1
However, in this study, these antibodies were not correlates of clinical immunity to malaria. @	1
Instead, heterogeneous exposure led to confounded, positive associations between increasing antibody concentration and increasing risk of clinical malaria. @	1
BACKGROUND RTS,S/AS01(E) is the lead candidate malaria vaccine and confers pre-erythrocytic immunity. `	0
Vaccination may therefore impact acquired immunity to blood-stage malaria parasites after natural infection. `	0
METHODS We measured, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antibodies to 4 Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens (AMA-1, MSP-1(42), EBA-175, and MSP-3) and by growth inhibitory activity (GIA) using 2 parasite clones (FV0 and 3D7) at 4 times on 860 children who were randomized to receive with RTS,S/AS01(E) or a control vaccine. `	0
In this work we define and study a natural generalization of the densest subgraph problem, where the main goal is to find at most $k$ subgraphs with maximum total aggregate density, while satisfying an upper bound on the pairwise Jaccard coefficient between the sets of nodes of the subgraphs. _	1
After showing that such a problem is NP-Hard, we devise an efficient algorithm that comes with provable guarantees in some cases of interest, as well as, an efficient practical heuristic. @	1
Our extensive evaluation on large real-world graphs confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. @	1
Finding dense subgraphs in large graphs is a key primitive in a variety of real-world application domains, encompassing social network analytics, event detection, biology, and finance. `	0
In most such applications, one typically aims at finding several (possibly overlapping) dense subgraphs which might correspond to communities in social networks or interesting events. `	0
While a large amount of work is devoted to finding a single densest subgraph, perhaps surprisingly, the problem of finding several dense subgraphs with limited overlap has not been studied in a principled way, to the best of our knowledge. _	0
This paper presents an artificial immune pattern recognition (AIPR) approach for the damage detection and classification in structures. `	1
The selective and adaptive features of the clonal selection algorithm allow the classifier to generate recognition feature vectors that are able to match the training data. @	1
In addition, the immune learning algorithm can learn and remember various data patterns by generating a set of memory cells that contains representative feature vectors for each class (pattern). @	1
The performance of the presented structure damage classifier has been validated using a benchmark structure proposed by the IASC-ASCE (International Association for Structural Control - American Society of Civil Engineers) Structural Health Monitoring Task Group. @	1
The validation results show a better classification success rate comparing to some of other classification algorithms. @	1
An AIPR-based Structure Damage Classifier (AIPR-SDC) has been developed by mimicking immune recognition and learning mechanisms. `	0
The structure damage patterns are represented by feature vectors that are extracted from the structure's dynamic response measurements. _	0
The training process is designed based on the clonal selection principle in the immune system. _	0
Here, we report the structure of this protein trimer, solved using anomalous diffraction and refined at 2 Å resolution. _	1
Amino acids 371-447 form a tapered pyramid with a triangular cross-section composed of interlocked β-sheets from each of the three chains. _	1
The exact topology of the β-sandwich fold is novel, but similar to that of knob domains of other viral fibers and the phage Sf6 needle. @	1
Several host-range change mutants have been mapped to loops located on the top of this tip domain, suggesting that this surface of the tip domain interacts with receptors on the cell surface. @	1
The six bacteriophage T7 tail fibers, homo-trimers of gene product 17, are thought to be responsible for the first specific, albeit reversible, attachment to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. `	0
The protein trimer forms kinked fibers comprised of an amino-terminal tail-attachment domain, a slender shaft, and a carboxyl-terminal domain composed of several nodules. `	0
Previously, we expressed, purified, and crystallized a carboxyl-terminal fragment comprising residues 371-553. `	0
The triangular pyramid domain has three α-helices at its narrow end, which are connected to a carboxyl-terminal three-blade β-propeller tip domain by flexible loops. _	0
The monomers of this tip domain each contain an eight-stranded β-sandwich. @	0
We measured higher-level functional capacity, depressive state, and possible confounders. _	1
Then, we estimated the marginal odds ratios (i.e., the change in odds of impaired higher-level functional capacity if all versus no participants were exposed to depressive state) by logistic models using generalized linear models with the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for propensity score and design-based standard errors. _	1
Depressive state was used as the exposure variable and higher-level functional capacity as the outcome variable. @	1
The all absolute standardized differences after the IPTW using the propensity scores were < 10% which indicated negligible differences in the mean or prevalence of the covariates between non-depressive state and depressive state. @	1
The marginal odds ratios were 2.17 (95%CI: 1.13-4.19) for men and 2.57 (95%CI: 1.26-5.26) for women. @	1
Depressive state has been reported to be significantly associated with higher-level functional capacity among community-dwelling elderly. `	0
However, few studies have investigated the associations among people with long-term care requirements. `	0
We aimed to investigate the associations between depressive state and higher-level functional capacity and obtain marginal odds ratios using propensity score analyses in people with long-term care requirements. `	0
We conducted a cross-sectional study based on participants aged ≥ 65 years (n = 545) who were community dwelling and used outpatient care services for long-term preventive care. _	0
The marginal odds ratios were estimated by the logistic models with IPTW using the propensity scores. @	0
Prevention of depressive state may contribute to not only depressive state but also higher-level functional capacity. @	0
Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that these were novel alleles of BRI1 (Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1), which encodes a receptor kinase that may act as a receptor for BRs or be involved in downstream signaling. `	1
The results of morphological and molecular analyses indicated that these represent a range of alleles from weak to null. `	1
However, bri1-4 plants accumulated very high levels of brassinolide, castasterone, and typhasterol (57-, 128-, and 33-fold higher, respectively, than those of wild-type plants). _	1
Weaker alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6) also accumulated considerable levels of brassinolide, castasterone, and typhasterol, but less than the null allele (bri1-4). @	1
The levels of 6-deoxoBRs in bri1 mutants were comparable to that of wild type. @	1
The accumulation of biologically active BRs may result from the inability to utilize these active BRs, the inability to regulate BR biosynthesis in bri1 mutants, or both. @	1
Therefore, BRI1 is required for the homeostasis of endogenous BR levels. @	1
Seven dwarf mutants resembling brassinosteroid (BR)-biosynthetic dwarfs were isolated that did not respond significantly to the application of exogenous BRs. `	0
The endogenous BRs were examined from 5-week-old plants of a null allele (bri1-4) and two weak alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6). _	0
Previous analysis of endogenous BRs in several BR-biosynthetic dwarf mutants revealed that active BRs are deficient in these mutants. _	0
Compared to matched adolescents from a national probability sample, adolescents with same-sex parents were more likely to report occasional substance use but not more likely to report heavy use. @	1
No associations were found between substance use and homophobic stigmatization or life satisfaction. @	1
Although studies show that adolescents with same-sex parents experience homophobic discrimination, little is known about associations between stigmatization and substance use in this population. `	0
The 17-year-old offspring of lesbian parents from the largest, longest-running, longitudinal study of same-sex parented families were surveyed about substance use, experiences of homophobic stigmatization, and overall life satisfaction. _	0
First, overabundance of nuclear Myc triggered RS promptly, already after one day of Myc induction, causing slow replication fork progression and fork asymmetry, even before any metabolic changes occurred. _	1
In contrast, Ras overexpression initially induced a burst of cell proliferation and increased the speed of replication fork progression. _	1
However, after several days of induction Ras caused bioenergetic metabolic changes that correlated with slower DNA replication fork progression and the ensuing cell cycle arrest, gradually leading to senescence. @	1
Second, the observed oncogene-induced RS and metabolic alterations were cell-type/context dependent, as shown by comparative analyses of normal human BJ fibroblasts versus U2-OS sarcoma cells. @	1
Third, the energy metabolic reprogramming triggered by Ras was more robust compared to impact of Myc. @	1
Fourth, the detected oncogene-induced oxidative stress was due to ROS (superoxide) of non-mitochondrial origin and mitochondrial OXPHOS was reduced (Crabtree effect). @	1
Overall, our study provides novel insights into oncogene-evoked metabolic reprogramming, replication and oxidative stress, with implications for mechanisms of tumorigenesis and potential targeting of oncogene addiction. @	1
Both Myc and Ras oncogenes impact cellular metabolism, deregulate redox homeostasis and trigger DNA replication stress (RS) that compromises genomic integrity. `	0
However, how are such oncogene-induced effects evoked and temporally related, to what extent are these kinetic parameters shared by Myc and Ras, and how are these cellular changes linked with oncogene-induced cellular senescence in different cell context(s) remain poorly understood. `	0
Here, we addressed the above-mentioned open questions by multifaceted comparative analyses of human cellular models with inducible expression of c-Myc and H-RasV12 (Ras), two commonly deregulated oncoproteins operating in a functionally connected signaling network. `	0
Our study of DNA replication parameters using the DNA fiber approach and time-course assessment of perturbations in glycolytic flux, oxygen consumption and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed the following results. _	0
Data were obtained at week 4, 12, 24 and 48 and were analysed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.ResultsDuring the first 48 weeks of antiretroviral therapy, there were no significant differences in the virological and immunological response with respect to the MDR1 2677 and 3435 genotypes and the 2677/3435 haplotype.ConclusionsIn view of different results from several studies concerning the influence of MDR1 polymorphisms on the immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy, further studies with larger patient groups and longer follow-up are necessary in order to resolve conflicting issues. _	1
BackgroundIn a retrospective study of HIV-infected patients, we investigated the influence of the MDR1 genotype (G2677T/A and C3435T) on the virological and immunological response of treatment naïve patients.MethodsThe MDR1 genotype was analysed from 72 patients in whom antiretroviral therapy was initiated between 1998 and 2004. `	0
After a microarray screening study, we analysed the expression of specific miRNA during oocyte maturation and early embryo development until preimplantation stages. _	1
Mature and precursor forms of miR-21 and miR-130a were quantified by qRT-PCR in pools of 20 oocytes at GV (germinal vesicle), GV breakdown and metaphase II stages as well as in pools of embryos at the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell and blastocyst stages. _	1
The results showed a linear increase during the 1-8 cell stage for the mature forms of miR-130a and miR-21 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.003, respectively) and for the precursor form of miR-130a (P < 0.002). @	1
To see if this increase was due to minor transcriptional activity, 2-cell embryos were exposed to α-amanitin for 30-34 h. Results showed a significant decrease in miR-21, pre-miR-21, miR-130a and SRFS3 in α-amanitin-treated embryos (P < 0.05). @	1
In animals, the maternal-to-embryonic transition (MET) occurs in the first days of early development and involves the degradation of maternal transcripts that have been stored during oogenesis. `	0
Moreover, precise and specific control mechanisms govern the adequate synchronization of the MET events to promote the activation of the embryonic genome. `	0
These mechanisms are not well understood, but it is believed that microRNAs (miRNAs) could be one of the mechanisms involved. `	0
Two differentially expressed candidates were selected for further analysis. _	0
Considering the potential regulatory role of these miRNA, the bovine genome was screened to identify putative targets with a 3'UTR exact seed match. @	0
This study suggests that miRNAs could be important players in the MET, as expression profiles suggest a potential regulation role during early development steps. @	0
Our results clearly show that, in a cell-free system, cholesterol is not an efficient activator of NADPH oxidase like arachidonic acid (AA), however it triggers a basal low superoxide production at concentrations similar to what found in neutrophile. _	1
A higher concentration, if present during the assembly process of the enzyme, has an inhibitory role on the production of O2(•-). @	1
Added cholesterol acts on both cytosolic and membrane components, leading to imperfect assembly and decreasing the affinity of cytosolic subunits to the membrane ones. @	1
Added to the cytosolic proteins, it retains their conformations but still allows some conformational change induced by AA addition, indispensable to activation of NADPH oxidase. @	1
The NADPH oxidase Nox2, a multi-subunit enzyme complex comprising membrane and cytosolic proteins, catalyzes a very intense production of superoxide ions O2(•-), which are transformed into other reactive oxygen species (ROS). `	0
In vitro, it has to be activated by addition of amphiphiles like arachidonic acid (AA). `	0
It has been shown that the membrane part of phagocyte NADPH oxidase is present in lipid rafts rich in cholesterol. `	0
Cholesterol plays a significant role in the development of cardio-vascular diseases that are always accompanied by oxidative stress. _	0
Our aim was to investigate the influence of cholesterol on the activation process of NADPH oxidase. _	0
This paper provides an overview of the current and emerging issues in learning technology research, concentrating on structural issues such as infrastructure, policy and organizational context. `	1
It updates the vision of technology outlined by Squires' (1999) concept of peripatetic electronic teachers (PETs) where Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide an enabling medium to allow teachers to act as freelance agents in a virtual world and reflects to what extent this vision has been realized The paper begins with a survey of some of the key areas of ICT development and provides a contextualizing framework for the area in terms of external agendas and policy drivers. _	1
It then focuses upon learning technology developments which have occurred in the last five years in the UK and offers a number of alternative taxonomies to describe this. @	1
The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues which arise from this work. @	0

In the proposed hybrid approach, the finite volume (FV) element, consisting of structured FV subcells, is embedded in the base hexahedral element containing discontinuity, and an FV based high-order shock-capturing scheme is employed to overcome the Gibbs phenomena. `	1
In this paper, the 5th-order WENO scheme with the characteristic decomposition is employed as the shock-capturing scheme in the embedded FV element, and the 5th-order SD method is used in the smooth flow field. @	1
Overall, it is shown that the proposed hybrid method results in comparable or better simulation results compared with the standalone WENO scheme when the same number of solution DOF is considered in both SD and FV elements. @	1
A novel hybrid spectral difference/embedded finite volume method is introduced in order to apply a discontinuous high-order method for large scale engineering applications involving discontinuities in the flows with complex geometries. `	0
Thus, a discontinuity is captured at the resolution of FV subcells within an embedded FV element. `	0
In the smooth flow region, the SD element is used in the base hexahedral element. _	0
Then, the governing equations are solved by the SD method. _	0
The SD method is chosen for its low numerical dissipation and computational efficiency preserving high-order accurate solutions. _	0
The coupling between the SD element and the FV element is achieved by the globally conserved mortar method. @	0
The order of accuracy study and various 1D and 2D test cases are carried out, which involve the discontinuities and vortex flows. @	0
Here we describe the results of recent excavations at Kalinga in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon in the Philippines that have yielded 57 stone tools associated with an almost-complete disarticulated skeleton of Rhinoceros philippinensis, which shows clear signs of butchery, together with other fossil fauna remains attributed to stegodon, Philippine brown deer, freshwater turtle and monitor lizard. _	1
This evidence pushes back the proven period of colonization 6 of the Philippines by hundreds of thousands of years, and furthermore suggests that early overseas dispersal in Island South East Asia by premodern hominins took place several times during the Early and Middle Pleistocene stages1–4. @	1
Stone tools and a disarticulated and butchered skeleton of Rhinoceros philippinensis, found in a securely dated stratigraphic context, indicate the presence of an unknown hominin population in the Philippines as early as 709 thousand years ago. @	1
Over 60 years ago, stone tools and remains of megafauna were discovered on the Southeast Asian islands of Flores, Sulawesi and Luzon, and a Middle Pleistocene colonization by Homo erectus was initially proposed to have occurred on these islands1–4. `	0
However, until the discovery of Homo floresiensis in 2003, claims of the presence of archaic hominins on Wallacean islands were hypothetical owing to the absence of in situ fossils and/or stone artefacts that were excavated from well-documented stratigraphic contexts, or because secure numerical dating methods of these sites were lacking. `	0
As a consequence, these claims were generally treated with scepticism 5 . _	0
All finds originate from a clay-rich bone bed that was dated to between 777 and 631 thousand years ago using electron-spin resonance methods that were applied to tooth enamel and fluvial quartz. @	0
The Philippines therefore may have had a central role in southward movements into Wallacea, not only of Pleistocene megafauna 7 , but also of archaic hominins. @	0
We performed RNA-seq on pairs of tibial diaphyseal bones from four 16-week-old mice with each of the aforementioned genotypes. _	1
We then evaluated different methods for controlling for contaminating nonskeletal tissue (ie, blood, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle) in our data. _	1
These methods included predigestion of diaphyseal bone with collagenase and separate transcriptional profiling of blood, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow. _	1
We found that collagenase digestion reduced contamination, but also altered gene expression in the remaining cells. @	1
In contrast, in silico filtering of the diaphyseal bone RNA-seq data for highly expressed blood, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow transcripts significantly increased the correlation between RNA-seq data from an animal's right and left tibias and from animals with the same Lrp5 genotype. @	1
We conclude that reliable and reproducible RNA-seq data can be obtained from mouse diaphyseal bone and that lack of LRP5 has a more pronounced effect on gene expression than the HBM-causing LRP5 missense mutation. @	1
We identified 84 differentially expressed protein-coding transcripts between LRP5 "sufficient" (ie, Lrp5(+/+) and Lrp5(p.A214V/+) ) and "insufficient" (Lrp5(-/-) ) diaphyseal bone, and far fewer differentially expressed genes between Lrp5(p.A214V/+) and Lrp5(+/+) diaphyseal bone. @	1
Loss-of-function and certain missense mutations in the Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) significantly decrease or increase bone mass, respectively. `	0
These human skeletal phenotypes have been recapitulated in mice harboring Lrp5 knockout and knock-in mutations. `	0
We hypothesized that measuring mRNA expression in diaphyseal bone from mice with Lrp5 wild-type (Lrp5(+/+) ), knockout (Lrp5(-/-) ), and high bone mass (HBM)-causing (Lrp5(p.A214V/+) ) knock-in alleles could identify genes and pathways that regulate or are regulated by LRP5 activity. `	0
It is shown that for generic games, an equilibrium is robust under non-common priors if and only if it consists of the unique rationalizable action profile. @	1
Set valued concepts are also introduced, and for generic games, a smallest robust set is shown to exist and coincide with the set of a posteriori equilibria. @	1
This paper considers the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information, where players are allowed to have heterogenous priors. `	0
An equilibrium of a complete information game is robust to incomplete information under non-common priors if for every incomplete information game where each player's prior puts high probability on the event that the players know at arbitrarily high order that the payoffs are given by the complete information game, there exists a Bayesian Nash equilibrium that generates behavior close to the equilibrium in consideration. _	0
We have analyzed a mutation in exon 10 of the human aromatase gene and show that an unambiguous genotype could be elucidated in more than 90% of the analyzed samples. _	1
Compared to analysis by full sequencing, 4 times more samples can be analyzed per gel, so that the sample capacity of the gel is approaching that of alternative gel-based methods for genotype analysis. @	1
Unlike many of these, the method offers direct identification of the variant sequence position and on-line analysis without the need of post-electrophoretic processing of the gel. @	1
This work shows that single sequencing reactions analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer can be an efficient way of screening PCR products for known mutations. `	0
We are concerned with magnetic vector potentials which are homogeneous of degree -1, including the Aharonov-Bohm class. _	1
In particular, by variational arguments we prove a result of multiplicity of solutions distinguished by symmetry properties. @	1
We investigate existence and qualitative behaviour of solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with critical exponent and singular electromagnetic potentials. `	0
SUMMARY In the context of metagenomics, we introduce a new approach to protein database search called PAUDA, which runs ~10,000 times faster than BLASTX, while achieving about one-third of the assignment rate of reads to KEGG orthology groups, and producing gene and taxon abundance profiles that are highly correlated to those obtained with BLASTX. `	1
PAUDA requires <80 CPU hours to analyze a dataset of 246 million Illumina DNA reads from permafrost soil for which a previous BLASTX analysis (on a subset of 176 million reads) reportedly required 800,000 CPU hours, leading to the same clustering of samples by functional profiles. _	1
AVAILABILITY PAUDA is freely available from: http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/pauda. @	0

In order to gain insights into the mechanism underlying the GS boosting effects on virulence, we analyzed differences in protein expression levels in control and glucose-starved trophozoites, by quantitative proteomic analysis. _	1
We observed that upstream regulatory element 3-binding protein (URE3-BP), a transcription factor that modulates E.histolytica virulence, and the lysine-rich protein 1 (KRiP1) which is induced during liver abscess development, are upregulated by GS. _	1
We also analyzed E. histolytica membrane fractions and noticed that the Gal/GalNAc lectin light subunit LgL1 is up-regulated by GS. _	1
Surprisingly, amoebapore A (Ap-A) and cysteine proteinase A5 (CP-A5), two important E. histolytica virulence factors, were strongly down-regulated by GS. @	1
While the boosting effect of GS on E. histolytica virulence was conserved in strains silenced for Ap-A and CP-A5, it was lost in LgL1 and in KRiP1 down-regulated strains. @	1
These data emphasize the unexpected role of GS in the modulation of E.histolytica virulence and the involvement of KRiP1 and Lgl1 in this phenomenon. @	1
The unicellular parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, is exposed to numerous adverse conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, during its life cycle stages in the human host. `	0
In the present study, we examined whether the parasite virulence could be influenced by glucose starvation (GS). `	0
The migratory behaviour of the parasite and its capability to kill mammalian cells and to lyse erythrocytes is strongly enhanced following GS. `	0
Zonulae occludentes and gap junctions were examined both in the intact mouse liver and in a junction-rich membrane fraction from homogenized mouse liver. `	1
These preparations were visualized with the techniques of uranyl acetate staining en bloc, staining with colloidal lanthanum, negative staining with phosphotungstate, and freeze-cleaving. `	1
The zonula occludens is arranged as a meshwork of branching and anastomosing threadlike contacts sealing the lumen of the bile canaliculus from the liver intercellular space. `	1
The gap junction is characterized in section by a 20 A gap between the apposed junctional membrane outer leaflets, and permeation of this space with lanthanum or phosphotungstate reveals a polygonal lattice of subunits with a center-to-center spacing of 90–100 A. Freeze-cleaved gap junctions show a similar lattice. _	1
Extraction of junction-rich fractions with 60% aqueous acetone results in a disappearance of the 20 A gap in sectioned pellets and an inability to demonstrate the polygonal lattice with either the freeze-cleave or negative staining techniques. _	1
Extraction of the membranes with 50% acetone does not produce this effect. _	1
Thin-layer chromatography of the acetone extracts reveals a group of phospholipids in the 60% extract that are not detectable in the 50% extract. @	1
Acetone does not cause any detectable change in the structure of the zonula occludens, but the occluding junction becomes leaky to lanthanum following acetone treatment. @	1
The effects of other reagents on the junctions are reported. @	1
RESULTS In men, the prevalences of overweight (BMI > or =25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI > or =30 kg/m2) were 45.5% and 16.9%, respectively, higher than in women (28.3% and 14.3%, respectively). _	1
The prevalence of abdominal obesity (waist > or =102 in men and > or =88 cm in women) was higher in women than in men (30.6% vs. 23.9%). _	1
Obesity and abdominal obesity increased with age and decreased with higher educational level in both genders. _	1
In women, the prevalence of obesity was lower among former and current smokers, whereas in men the prevalence of obesity was higher in former smokers but did not differ between current and never smokers. @	1
Multivariate analysis showed age to be positively related, and education and physical activity to be negatively related with obesity and abdominal obesity in both genders, whereas differential effects of smoking were found between genders. @	1
CONCLUSION The prevalence of abdominal obesity is higher than BMI-derived obesity in the Swiss population. @	1
Women presented with more abdominal obesity than men. @	1
The association between smoking and obesity levels appears to differ between genders. @	1
BACKGROUND Obesity can be defined using body mass index (BMI) or waist (abdominal obesity). `	0
Little information exists regarding its prevalence and determinants in Switzerland. `	0
Hence, we assessed the levels of obesity as defined by BMI or waist circumference in a Swiss population-based sample. `	0
METHODS Cross-sectional, population-based non-stratified random sample of 3,249 women and 2,937 men aged 35-75 years living in Lausanne, Switzerland. `	0
Overall participation rate was 41%. _	0
This review outlines purinergic receptor expression and signaling in stem cells metabolism. @	1
We will briefly describe current findings in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells as well as in cancer-, hematopoietic-, and neural crest-derived stem cells. @	1
The major focus will be placed on recent findings of purinergic signaling in mesenchymal stem cells addressed in in vitro and in vivo studies, since stem cell fate might be manipulated by this system guiding differentiation towards the desired lineage in the future. @	1
A major challenge modern society has to face is the increasing need for tissue regeneration due to degenerative diseases or tumors, but also accidents or warlike conflicts. `	0
There is great hope that stem cell-based therapies might improve current treatments of cardiovascular diseases, osteochondral defects or nerve injury due to the unique properties of stem cells such as their self-renewal and differentiation potential. `	0
Since embryonic stem cells raise severe ethical concerns and are prone to teratoma formation, adult stem cells are still in the focus of research. `	0
Emphasis is placed on cellular signaling within these cells and in between them for a better understanding of the complex processes regulating stem cell fate. _	0
One of the oldest signaling systems is based on nucleotides as ligands for purinergic receptors playing an important role in a huge variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. _	0
Besides their natural ligands, several artificial agonists and antagonists have been identified for P1 and P2 receptors and are already used as drugs. _	0
In this study, we demonstrated that both subunits were expressed and that the purified heteroallelic enzymes, were catalytically active. _	1
As expected, the produced proteins displayed enzymatic activities levels lower than the predicted catalytic activity, calculated by averaging in vitro PAH activities from both alleles, and were strongly dependent on the proteins subunit composition. @	1
The obtained data suggest that interactions between the studied hPAH subunits, namely the I65T, R261Q, R270K and V388M, and the wild-type protein occurred. @	1
To study the interaction between two different subunits of the heteromeric human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH), present in hyperphenylalaninemic (HPA) compound heterozygous patients, heteroallelic hPAH enzymes were produced. `	0
A dual vector expression system was used (PRO Bacterial Expression System) in which each mutant subunit was expressed from a separate compatible vector, with different epitope tags, in a single bacterial host. `	0
Experimental conditions were selected in order that each plasmid produced equivalent levels of mutant subunits. _	0
As postulated, this phenomenon could be a source of phenotypic variation in genetic diseases involving multimeric proteins. @	0
In this study, we show that BNIP3 expression increases in stressed cardiomyocytes in vitro and in response to pressure overload in vivo, and that its transcription is directly related to JNK activity. `	1
BNIP3 expression gradually increased in the first weeks after pressure overload and peaked at the heart failure stage. `	1
Ultrastructurally, the mitochondrial area was inversely proportional to BNIP3 expression. _	1
Both JNK and AKT activities increased with pressure overload; however, JNK signaling dominated over AKT signaling for the activation of the transcription factor FOXO3a and for the transcription of its effector, BNIP3. _	1
3-methyladenine attenuated JNK signaling and significantly decreased BNIP3 expression and reversed cardiac remodeling in heart failure. _	1
Ultrastructurally, the mitochondrial area was significantly increased in the 3-methyladenine group compared with placebo. @	1
Moreover, adenoviral gene delivery of dominant negative JNK in a rat model of pressure overload hypertrophy abolished the increase in BNIP3 expression in response to pressure overload. @	1
These results suggest that JNK signaling is a critical modulator of the transcription factor FOXO3a driving the expression of its effector, BNIP3, in heart failure and that JNK, through BNIP3, induces mitochondrial apoptosis and mitophagy. @	1
Bcl-2 E1B 19-KDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is a mitochondrial death and mitophagy marker, which is involved in inducing cardiac remodeling post myocardial infarction. `	0
In this work, stable carbon isotope analysis was employed to analyse the subsamples of C. sinensis from 5 representative habitats. _	1
The results demonstrated that these samples possessed similar δ13C profiles, i.e., a steady ascending trend from the top to the bottom of stroma, occurrence of the δ13C maximum at the head, a slight decrease from the head to the end of thorax, a sharply descent trend from the end of thorax to the forepart of abdomen, and maintenance of lower δ13C values in the rest parts of abdomen. _	1
Based on the data, we consider that the site near the head of the host larva may be the initial target attacked by O. sinensis, and the fungus growth is closely related to the digestive tract of its host larva. @	1
The growth stages of O. sinensis are accordingly speculated as the symptom-free, symptom-appearing, and stroma-germinating stages. @	1
For more than one thousand years, Cordyceps sinensis has been revered as a unique halidom in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for its mysterious life history and predominant medicinal values. `	0
This mysterious fungus-larva symbiote also attracted the over-exploitation, while several problems on the initial colonization of Ophiocordyceps sinensis in the host larva have constrained artificial cultivation. `	0
Electrophoresis of bacteriophages was achieved by applying a positive potential on an indium tin oxide electrode at the bottom of the nanowells. `	1
Nanoscale arrays of phages with different surface densities were obtained by changing the electric field applied to the bottom of the nanowells. _	1
The applied voltage was shown to be the critical factor in generating a well-ordered phage array. _	1
The fluorescence signal was enhanced by the intrinsic photonic effect made available by the geometry of the platform. @	1
It was shown that the quantification of phages on the array was 6 orders of magnitude better than could be obtained with a fluorescent plate reader. @	1
The device opens up the possibility that phages can be detected directly without enrichment or culturing, and by detecting phages that specifically infect bacteria of interest, rapid pathogen detection becomes possible. @	1
A highly ordered array of T7 bacteriophages was created by the electrophoretic capture of phages onto a nanostructured array with wells that accommodated the phages. `	0
The number of wells occupied by a phage, and hence the concentration of phages in a sample solution, could be quantified by using a DNA intercalating dye that rapidly stains the T7 phage. @	0
In this work, we propose Chimera, a shared factorization model that can simultaneously account for graph links, content, and temporal analysis. _	1
This approach works by extracting the latent semantic structure of the network in multidimensional form, but in a way that takes into account the temporal continuity of these embeddings. _	1
Such an approach simplifies temporal analysis of the underlying network by using the embedding as a surrogate. @	1
A consequence of this simplification is that it is also possible to use this temporal sequence of embeddings to predict future communities. @	1
We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach. @	1
In this work, we consider the problem of combining link, content and temporal analysis for community detection and prediction in evolving networks. `	0
Such temporal and content-rich networks occur in many real-life settings, such as bibliographic networks and question answering forums. `	0
Most of the work in the literature (that uses both content and structure) deals with static snapshots of networks, and they do not reflect the dynamic changes occurring over multiple snapshots. `	0
Incorporating dynamic changes in the communities into the analysis can also provide useful insights about the changes in the network such as the migration of authors across communities. _	0
We present our experience while treating patients with severe bilateral MTS submitted to invasive recordings. `	1
RESULTS Invasive video-EEG showed exclusively unilateral seizure onset in seven patients; in two patients, seizures originating from both temporal lobes were found (80% of them originated from one side). _	1
Five patients were submitted to left and four to right CAH. _	1
Seven patients were rendered seizure-free after surgery (Engel I); the other two were rated as Engel II. @	1
There was no additional memory decline. @	1
There was no surgical morbidity or mortality. @	1
Pathological examination showed MTS in all patients. @	1
DISCUSSION Good surgical outcome (77% seizure-free patients) could be obtained even in this apparently unsuitable group of patients. @	1
All patients benefit from the procedure. @	1
We did not see any cognitive decline in our patients with severe bilateral MTS. @	1
Patients with severe bilateral MTS would need invasive recordings despite any findings during surface video-EEG. @	1
INTRODUCTION Although some degree of bilateral hippocampal involvement might be frequent in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, severe bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is very rare. `	0
METHODS Nine adult patients were studied. `	0
All patients had simple and complex partial seizures. `	0
All patients had bilateral independent interictal temporal lobe spiking and non-lateralizing video-EEG findings. `	0
MRI showed severe bilateral MTS and no other brain lesion. `	0
All patients had severe verbal and non-verbal memory deficits. _	0
All patients were submitted to invasive recordings after bilateral subdural grids implantation. _	0
Cortico-amygdalo-hippocampectomy (CAH) was performed in all patients on the side suggested by invasive recording. _	0
Follow-up time ranged from 5 to 10 years. _	0
This paper presents a formal specification of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol using AWN (Algebra for Wireless Networks), a recent process algebra which has been tailored for the modelling of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks and Wireless Mesh Network protocols. `	1
Our formalisation models the exact details of the core functionality of AODV, such as route discovery, route maintenance and error handling. _	1
We demonstrate how AWN can be used to reason about critical protocol properties by providing detailed proofs of loop freedom and route correctness. @	1
RESULTS Mean severity scores for parenchymal necrosis in the liver (P < 0.01), portal fibrosis (P < 0.01), biliary duct proliferation (P < 0.001), cholangitis/ pericholangitis (P < 0.01), hyperemia in the biliary ducts (P < 0.01), and fibrosis (P < 0.01) were significantly lower in rats treated with formalin + melatonin compared with those treated with formalin alone. @	1
No significant differences were observed between the 3 treatment groups with respect to t½, a parameter used to assess the secretion function of the hepatocytes. @	1
However, the t½ was significantly longer in the treatment groups compared with controls (P < 0.001). @	1
CONCLUSION In this experimental study in a rat model of caustic sclerosing cholangitis, the histopathologic and scintigraphic findings suggested that melatonin is effective in attenuating the damage caused by scolicidal agents on the liver and biliary ducts. @	1
BACKGROUND Hydatid disease is a worldwide health problem. `	0
Treatment is surgical or percutaneous, using scolicidal agents. `	0
Caustic sclerosing cholangitis might develop after the contact of scolicidal agents with the biliary ducts. `	0
Melatonin, an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic agent, might be used in the treatment of caustic sclerosing cholangitis due to its possible preventive effects on fibrosis and cell damage. `	0
OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on an experimentally developed caustic sclerosing cholangitis with scolicidal solution (formalin) in a rat model. _	0
METHODS Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats aged 11 to 13 weeks and weighing 250 ± 30 g were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups of 10: formalin 5% at 0.5 mL/d + melatonin placebo; formalin placebo + intraperitoneal melatonin 10 mg/kg/d; formalin 5% at 0.5 mL/d + melatonin 10 mg/kg/d; and formalin placebo and melatonin placebo (control). _	0
Hepatobiliary function was assessed using dynamic scintigraphy with technetium-99m-mebrofenin on study day 60. _	0
The histology of the liver and biliary duct specimens was examined on study day 60. _	0
In each group, histopathologic alterations were scored as absent, slight, mild, or severe. @	0
We present a new model that can classify unseen categories from their textual description. _	1
Specifically, we use text features to predict the output weights of both the convolutional and the fully connected layers in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). _	1
We take advantage of the architecture of CNNs and learn features at different layers, rather than just learning an embedding space for both modalities, as is common with existing approaches. @	1
The proposed model also allows us to automatically generate a list of pseudo- attributes for each visual category consisting of words from Wikipedia articles. @	1
We train our models end-to-end us- ing the Caltech-UCSD bird and flower datasets and evaluate both ROC and Precision-Recall curves. @	1
Our empirical results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods. @	1
One of the main challenges in Zero-Shot Learning of visual categories is gathering semantic attributes to accompany images. `	0
Recent work has shown that learning from textual descriptions, such as Wikipedia articles, avoids the problem of having to explicitly define these attributes. `	0
Herein, we present the rationale for dual targeting of IGF-1R and other signaling molecules as an effective strategy to combat acquired drug resistance by carcinomas and sarcomas. @	1
The insulin-like growth factor pathway, regulated by a complex interplay of growth factors, cognate receptors, and binding proteins, is critically important for many of the hallmarks of cancer such as oncogenesis, cell division, growth, and antineoplastic resistance. `	0
Naturally, a number of clinical trials have sought to directly abrogate insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) function and/or indirectly mitigate its downstream mediators such as mTOR, PI3K, MAPK, and others under the assumption that such therapeutic interventions would provide clinical benefit, demonstrable by impaired tumor growth as well as prolonged progression-free and overall survival for patients. _	0
Though a small subset of patients enrolled within phase I or II clinical trials revealed dramatic clinical response to IGF-1R targeted therapies (most using monoclonal antibodies to IGF-1R), in toto, the anticancer effect has been underwhelming and unsustained, as even those with marked clinical responses seem to rapidly acquire resistance to IGF-1R targeted agents when used alone through yet to be identified mechanisms. @	0
As the IGF-1R receptor is just one of many that converge upon common intracellular signaling cascades, it is likely that effective IGF-1R targeting must occur in parallel with blockade of redundant signaling paths. @	0
RESULTS Fifty-five nurses worked on the wards (105 beds). _	1
The total number of incidents was 142 over the 184 days of this study. @	1
There was a positive trend between the number of incidents and the total patient dependency score. @	1
The presence of accidental falls in the wards was associated with the presence of transfers from the intensive care unit to the wards (odds ratio 3.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.48, 6.65). @	1
CONCLUSION Greater nursing workloads may be related to the higher number of patient safety incidents in inpatient wards of hospitals. @	1
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between nursing workloads and patient safety incidents in inpatient wards of a general hospital. `	0
METHODS A retrospective data analysis was conducted involving the internal medicine wards in a teaching hospital in Japan between July 1st and December 31st, 2006. `	0
To assess associations between nursing workloads and patient safety incidents, we analyzed the following: the relationships between the level of patients' dependency and the number of incident reports; and the relationships between the presence of accidental falls and the presence of patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the wards. _	0
Using a foveated analysis framework, in which image patches were analyzed at the resolution corresponding to their eccentricity from the prior fixation, we studied the statistics of four low-level local image features: luminance, RMS contrast, and bandpass outputs of both luminance and contrast, and discovered that the image patches around human fixations had, on average, higher values of each of these features at all eccentricities than the image patches selected at random. _	1
Bandpass contrast showed the greatest difference between human and random fixations, followed by bandpass luminance, RMS contrast, and luminance. @	1
An eccentricity-based analysis showed that shorter saccades were more likely to land on patches with higher values of these features. @	1
Compared to a full-resolution analysis, foveation produced an increased difference between human and random patch ensembles for contrast and its higher-order statistics. @	1
Analysis of the statistics of image features at observers' gaze can provide insights into the mechanisms of fixation selection in humans. `	0
This paper describes a novel metadatadriven framework designed to automate the deployment of all application-specific functionality used by a middleware system. @	1
We used Java and XML to implement this framework in MOCHA, a middleware system developed at the University of Maryland. @	1
We first present the kind of services, metadata elements and software tools used in MOCHA to automate code deployment. @	1
Then, we describe how the features of MOCHA simplify the administration and reduce the management cost of a middleware system in a large scale environment. @	1
Abstract. `	0
Database middleware systems require the deployment of applicationspecific data types and query operators to the servers and clients in the system. `	0
Existing middleware solutions rely on developers and system administrators to port and manually install all this application-specific functionality to all sites in the system. _	0
This approach cannot scale to an environment in which there are hundreds of data sources, such as those accessed by the Web and even more customtailored applications, since the complexity and the cost involved in maintaining a code base system-wide are enormous. _	0
We propose an integrated architec ture for parsing speech inputs based on a parallel marker-passing scheme and attaining dynamic participation of knowledge from the phonological-level to the discourse-level. _	1
At the phonological level, we employ a stochastic model using a transition matrix and a confusion matrix and markers which carry a probability measure. @	1
At a higher level, syntactic/semantic and discourse processing, we integrate a case-based and constraint-based scheme in a consistent manner so that a priori probability and constraints, which reflect linguistic and discourse factors, are provided to the phonological level of processing. @	1
A probability/cost-based scheme in our model enables ambiguity resolution at various levels using one uniform principle. @	1
AbstractThis paper describes the parsing scheme in the <$Dm Dia l OG speech-to-speech dialog translation system, with special emphasis on the integration of speech and natural language processing. `	0
In this paper we present a novel technique for improving localization accuracy within a visual-inertial navigation system (VINS). _	1
We make use of training data to learn a model for the quality of visual features with respect to localization error in a given environment. _	1
This model maps each visual observation from a predefined prediction space of visual-inertial predictors onto a scalar weight, which is then used to scale the observation covariance matrix. @	1
In this way, our model can adjust the influence of each observation according to its quality. @	1
We discuss our choice of predictors and report substantial reductions in localization error on 4 km of data from the KITTI dataset, as well as on experimental datasets consisting of 700 m of indoor and outdoor driving on a small ground rover equipped with a Skybotix VI-Sensor. @	1
Navigation in unknown, chaotic environments continues to present a significant challenge for the robotics community. `	0
Lighting changes, self-similar textures, motion blur, and moving objects are all considerable stumbling blocks for state-of-the-art vision-based navigation algorithms. `	0
We give criteria for which a principal curvature becomes a bounded $C^\infty$-function at non-degenerate singular points of wave fronts by using geometric invariants. `	1
As applications, we study singularities of parallel surfaces and extended distance squared functions of wave fronts. _	1
Moreover, we relate these singularities to some geometric invariants of fronts. @	1
Here, a simple and novel one-pot synthetic strategy to prepare polystyrene (PS) hollow microspheres via irradiation-assisted free-radical polymerizing and self-assembly (IFPS) approach under γ-ray irradiation with no additives introduced into the system is presented. _	1
And PS/2,5-Diphenyloxazole (PPO) fluorescent microspheres have been prepared successfully by IFPS reaction, which can be used as scintillators for the detection of ionizing radiation. @	1
A linear relationship between emitted luminescence and dose-activity in water is obtained, which suggests that composite microspheres could be used as liquid scintillation in specific environment. @	1
To simply and multitudinously synthesize hollow microspheres in a pure system is important for relevant research and application. `	0
In this paper, we give a simple proof of the mathematical equivalence of barrier crossing, peak-background split, and local biasing. @	1
Several, apparently distinct, formalisms exist in the literature for predicting the clustering of dark matter halos. `	0
It has been noticed on a case-by-case basis that the predictions of these different methods agree in specific examples, but there is no general proof that they are equivalent. _	0
Cryoprobes can be used for performing tissue biopsies. `	1
The overall diagnostic yield was 60.5% and, in the lesions reached by EBUS, it was 74.2%. _	1
In 19 cases, the diagnosis was made with forceps as well as cryobiopsy and, in four cases, only with cryobiopsy. @	1
Cryobiopsies were significantly larger than forceps biopsies (11.17 mm(2) versus 4.69 mm(2), p<0.001). @	1
We observed one case of moderate bleeding. @	1
Transbronchial cryobiopsy with EBUS guidance is safe and useful to obtain histological samples. @	1
Larger tissue samples can be obtained by cryoprobe. @	1
Peripheral lung lesions are sometimes difficult to reach even with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and insufficient material is often obtained by transbronchial forceps biopsy. `	0
We evaluated the safety and feasibility of the cryoprobe in combination with EBUS for the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesion. `	0
Patients with peripheral lung lesions of up to 4 cm were enrolled. `	0
After identifying the lung lesion by radial EBUS, forceps biopsies and cryobiopsies were performed in a randomised order. _	0
We evaluated safety and feasibility, and compared diagnostic yield and sample size. _	0
39 patients were randomised and the peripheral lung lesion was reached in 31. _	0
In this paper, we survey recent progress on the theory of maximally monotone operators in general Banach space. `	1
We also extend various of the results and leave some open questions. _	1
Forty isolates were found to be either resistant, or intermediate, to erythromycin (3.2% of isolates); of these, more than 50% were identified as S. epidermidis. _	1
A total of 15 (1.2%) resistant isolates of staphylococci originated from foodstuffs. _	1
Resistance mediated by methylation – i.e. _	1
iMLSB-resistance (10 isolates with the erm(A) or erm(C) gene) and constitutive MLSB-resistance (one isolate with the erm(B) and erm(C) genes) – exhibited a significantly high level of resistance to erythromycin with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 64 – >128 mg/l (MICmode = >128 mg/l). _	1
In contrast, the efflux mechanism encoded by the msr(A) gene (13 isolates; MICrange = 4–128, MICmode = 128 mg/l), the inactivation mechanisms of resistance encoded by the mph(C) gene (three isolates; MICrange = 8–32 mg/l), and/or their combination (13 isolates; MICrange = 4–128, MICmode = 64 mg/l) led to lower MIC values. @	1
The efflux gene msr(A) dominated among the erythromycin-resistant isolates (65% of resistant isolates). @	1
This first report on the resistance of Staphylococcus spp. @	1
to erythromycin in the Czech Republic illustrates that, while occurrence was low, isolates from food were nevertheless carriers of erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), msr(A) and mph(C) genes for resistance to erythromycin and, therefore, represent a potential thread to humans. @	1
The aim of this study was to determine both the occurrence and the genetic basis of resistance to erythromycin among 1 235 Staphylococcus spp. `	0
isolates obtained between 2000 and 2006 from (a) raw milk and meat (1 704 samples), (b) foodstuffs produced from these (451 samples), and (c) contact surfaces at processing plants and dairy farms (363 samples) in the Czech Republic. `	0
Isolates were screened by broth microdilution method for resistance to erythromycin and further 11 antimicrobial agents. `	0
In addition, isolates were screened by agar dilution (erythromycin range 1–128 mg/l) and D-zone test for inducible resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (iMLSB). `	0
Results indicated that parent-reported patient behavioral problems accounted for a significant 26% of variance in family functioning. _	1
Post-hoc analysis revealed that externalizing behavior problems accounted for the majority of this variance compared to internalizing behavior problems. _	1
These results suggest that externalizing problems may have a more significant impact on these families than previous research indicates. @	1
Moreover, externalizing behaviors may significantly impact family adaptation and should be taken into consideration during routine clinical care. @	1
The objective of this study was to examine the relative contributions of both parental and adolescent functioning to family functioning in adolescent patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their families. `	0
Participants were 45 adolescents (27 male, 18 female) 13–17 years old (M = 15.41 years, SD = 1.32) with IBD and their parents. `	0
Families completed measures of patient behavioral functioning and depression, parent distress and family functioning. `	0
Disease severity assessments were completed via data provided by patients’ gastroenterologists. _	0
Further research is needed to replicate and expand upon these findings. @	0
Design options are compared considering different scanning and signaling procedures to evaluate access delay and system overhead. _	1
The channel structure and multiple access issues are also considered. @	1
The analysis demonstrates significant benefits of low-resolution fully digital architectures in comparison to single stream analog beamforming. @	1
The millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have recently attracted considerable interest for next-generation cellular systems due to the massive available bandwidths at these frequencies. `	0
However, a key challenge in designing mmWave cellular systems is initial access -- the procedure by which a mobile establishes an initial link-layer connection to a base station cell. `	0
MmWave communication relies on highly directional transmissions and the initial access procedure must thus provide a mechanism by which initial transmission directions can be searched in a potentially large angular space. _	0
In the present study, non-obese and non-diabetic patients were selected, so that any lipid metabolic abnormalities that were seen were not due to any metabolic syndrome. _	1
Although no insulin resistance was found in the olanzapine treatment group, high levels of triglyceride and RLP-cholesterol were induced by the glucose tolerance cookie test. @	1
This suggests that olanzapine has a direct action on lipid metabolism even after relatively short treatment duration (3–24 weeks). @	1
In contrast to the study by Henderson et al (2005), the present study in non-obese, non-diabetic subjects found no difference between patients treated with olanazpine and risperidone in fasting insulin levels which were all within the normal range. @	1
A possible reason for this difference between the studies may be the duration of drug treatment. @	1
In the Henderson study, the mean duration of treatment with olanzapine was 29.5 months, whereas it was only 12.3 weeks in the present study. @	1
Another possibility is the influence of racial differences. @	1
Asian people have reduced insulin secretion compared with Caucasians (Sasahara et al 2004), making it theoretically more difficult to detect metabolic abnormalities from fasting blood samples. @	1
This could explain why insulin resistance was not detected in our group of Japanese patients. @	1
The glucose tolerance test is clearly useful for earlier detection of lipid metabolic abnormalities. @	1
This is especially true for Japanese patients who have reduced insulin secretion compared with Caucasians and their metabolic abnormalities are not easily detected by conventional markers. @	1
Higher levels of RLP-cholesterol have recently been suggested to be a risk factor for arteriosclerosis (Takeichi et al 1999). @	1
In a 3-year follow-up study of patients with coronary artery disease, patients with higher RLP-cholesterol (>5.1 mg/dL) had a significantly greater risk of developing coronary events than lower RLP-cholesterol patients (<3.3 mg/dL) (Kugiyama et al 1999). @	1
The present study suggests that patients treated with olanzapine should be routinely tested using the glucose tolerance cookie test to determine RLP-cholesterol level as a risk marker for the development of coronary events. @	1
In clinical practice, the high incidence of metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia, seen in schizophrenic patients are the result of a complex interaction of a number of factors, including lifestyle, overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and antipsychotic medication. `	0
Antipsychotic-induced metabolic abnormalities have been thought to be due to insulin resistance caused by obesity, which is a major side-effect of antipsychotics. `	0
However, there is increasing evidence that second-generation antipsychotics can also have direct metabolic effects. `	0
We investigated two similar groups of 9 non-obese, non-diabetic Japanese schizophrenic patients taking either risperidone or olanzapine as monotherapy for 3–66 weeks with no changes in their treatment for at least 3 weeks. `	0
The published Japanese definitions for obesity (BMI >25, waist measurement at umbilicus level >85 cm for males, >90 cm for females) and diabetes (fasting glucose > 110 mg/dL) were used (Matsuzawa et al 2005). `	0
Metabolic markers (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were measured in blood samples taken after 12 h fasting. `	0
Subjects then ingested a 110 g glucose tolerance test cookie (Harano et al 2006) and blood was taken 2 h later for measurement of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLP) cholesterol levels. `	0
Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (Emoto et al 1999). `	0
RLP were measured as the unbound serum fraction in an immuno-affinity mixed gel using monoclonal antibodies to apoA-I and apoB100 (Nakajima et al 1996). `	0
RLP-cholesterol levels were determined as the cholesterol fraction. `	0
Fasting values and those obtained 2 h after the glucose tolerance test are shown in Table 1. `	0
Plasma glucose levels remained within normal limits for both groups although those in the olanzapine group were significantly increased after the test compared with fasting levels. `	0
Insulin levels were significantly increased to a similar extent in both groups after the glucose tolerance test. `	0
No insulin resistance was seen in any patient. _	0
Table 1    Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism markers        The triglyceride levels were significantly increased compared to fasting levels in the olanzapine group but not in the risperidone group. _	0
The value over the normal limit (>150 mg/dL) indicates that lipid metabolic abnormalities may occur in the olanzapine group. _	0
In addition, the level of RLP-cholesterol in the olanzapine group was also significantly increased compared to the risperidone group. _	0
Higher fasting serum insulin levels have been found in schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine compared with those treated with conventional antipsychotics, suggesting possible insulin resistance (Melkersson et al 1999). _	0
Similarly treatment with olanzapine resulted in elevated serum insulin levels compared to baseline values in a 5-month study (Melkersson et al 2000). _	0
These studies suggest that certain antipsychotics can induce insulin resistance. _	0
It is not clear, however, from these studies whether the effect results from metabolic syndromes, such as weight gain and obesity, or a direct effect. _	0
Evidence for a direct effect is accumulating. _	0
A recent study of non-obese, non-diabetic schizophrenics showed elevated fasting insulin levels with clozapine and olanzapine (Henderson et al 2005). _	0
In this study, insulin resistance was significantly reduced in patients on clozapine or olanzapine compared with those on risperidone. _	0
In addition, in vitro studies have shown a direct effect of clozapine and olanzapine but not conventional antipsychotics on the stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (Melkersson 2004). _	0
Based on the Merkle signature scheme and Winternitz one-time signatures we propose a signature scheme with bounded side-channel leakage that is secure in a post-quantum setting. _	1
Novel algorithmic improvements for the authentication path computation bound side-channel leakage and improve the average signature computation time by close to 50 % when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. @	1
The proposed scheme is implemented on an Intel Core i7 CPU and an AVR ATxmega microcontroller with carefully optimized versions for the respective target platform. @	1
The theoretical algorithmic improvements are verified in the implementations and cryptographic hardware accelerators are used to achieve competitive performance.Keywords. @	1

Abstract. `	0
Digital signatures have become a key component of many embedded system solutions and are facing strong security and efficiency requirements. `	0
At the same time side-channel resistance is essential for a signature scheme to be accepted in real-world applications. _	0
In this study, we show that Col2a1-Cre-driven deletion of Shox2 in developing chondrocytes also results in shortening of the stylopodial skeleton (i.e. `	1
humerus, femur) and that this rhizomelia is due to precocious chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy. _	1
We demonstrate, using the micromass culture model system, that increased BMP activity triggers accelerated maturation and hypertrophy in Col2a1-Cre Shox2 mutant chondrocytes and we confirm in vivo that elevated transcript levels and expanded expression domains of Bmp2 and 4 are associated with premature formation of the hypertrophic zone in mutant humeri. _	1
In micromass cultures of Prrx1-Cre Shox2 mutant limb cells, we find that Shox2 deletion in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells results in increased BMP activity that enhances early chondrogenesis, but is insufficient to provoke chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy. _	1
Similarly, shRNA-mediated Shox2 knockdown in multipotent C3H10T1/2 cells and primary mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells results in spontaneous chondrogenesis in the absence of chondrostimulation, but again fails to induce progression through the later stages of chondrogenic differentiation. @	1
Importantly, exogenous BMP supplementation can overcome the block to maturation and hypertrophy caused by Shox2 depletion prior to overt chondrogenesis. @	1
Thus, we provide evidence that Shox2 regulates progression through chondrogenesis at two distinct stages--the onset of early differentiation and the transition to maturation and hypertrophy. @	1
In humans, loss of SHOX gene function is responsible for the mesomelic short stature characteristic of Turner syndrome, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, and Langer dysplasia. `	0
In a mouse model of SHOX deficiency, Prrx1-Cre-driven limb-specific deletion of the paralogous gene Shox2 results in severe rhizomelia. `	0
Pre-operative computed tomography scans revealed a large complex cystic and solid mass in the tail of the pancreas; the patient underwent a laparoscopic spleen-preserving left pancreatectomy. _	1
The tumor was shown to be made of cystic and solid components, with a grossly grey/ white appearance. _	1
A histological evaluation of the tumor revealed two elements separated from each other, one component was a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the other component exhibited a sarcomatous growth pattern, composed of spindle cells and multinucleated giant cells. @	1
Immunohistochemically, the epithelial area was positive for cytokeratin (CK) and negative for vimentin, while the sarcomatoid area was negative for CK and positive for vimentin. @	1
These observations confirmed a diagnosis of pancreatic carcinosarcoma. @	1
Although the patient was treated by gemcitabine following surgery, the outcome was extremely poor and the patient succumbed to sarcomatoid carcinoma three months after the treatment. @	1
Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the pancreas is extremely rare. `	0
The current report presents a case of carcinosarcoma of the pancreas in a 48-year-old male. `	0
Skewed age and sex ratios may reflect varying vulnerability to capture, through differences in behaviour or segregation in populations. _	1
Adult females constituted the second largest portion of the bycatch for both species, with potential consequences for population sustainability. @	1
Depth was the most important parameter influencing bycatch of both species and reflected what is known about common and striped dolphin habitat use in the region as the probability of catching common dolphins decreased, and striped dolphins increased, with increasing depth. @	1
Striped dolphin capture was similarly influenced by the extent to which operations were conducted in daylight, with the probability of capture increasing with increased operations in the pre-sunset and post-sunrise period, potentially driven by increased ability of observers to record animals during daylight operations, or by diurnal movements increasing contact with the fishery. @	1
Effort, based on net length and soak time, had little influence on the probability of capturing either species. @	1
Our results illustrate the importance of assessing the demographic of the animals captured during observer programmes and, perhaps more importantly, suggest that effort restrictions alone may not be sufficient to eradicate bycatch in areas where driftnets and small cetaceans co-occur. @	1
Fisheries bycatch is a key threat to cetacean species globally. `	0
Managing the impact requires an understanding of the conditions under which animals are caught and the sections of the population affected. `	0
We used observer data collected on an albacore tuna gillnet fishery in the northeast Atlantic, to assess operational and environmental factors contributing to bycatch of common and striped dolphins, using generalised linear models and model averaging. `	0
Life history demographics of the captured animals were also investigated. `	0
In both species, young males dominated the catch. _	0
The age ratio of common dolphins was significantly different from that estimated for the population in the region, based on life tables (G = 17.1, d.f. _	0
= 2, p = 0.002). _	0
RESULTS At 15 months after treatment initiation, 85 patients (32%) were considered excellent responders; 92 (36%), intermediate responders; and 85 (32%), poor responders. _	1
Compared with an intermediate or poor response, an excellent response was associated with lower baseline disability score (range, 0-3 points, with 0 being the best score; adjusted odds ratio [OR] per point increase, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33-0.74); fewer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) (including methotrexate) used before initiating etanercept (adjusted OR per DMARD used, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.95), and younger age at onset (adjusted OR per year increase, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99). _	1
Compared with an intermediate or excellent response, a poor response was associated with systemic JIA (adjusted OR systemic vs nonsystemic categories, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.26-6.80), and female sex (adjusted OR female vs male, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.12-4.18). _	1
Within the first 15 months of etanercept treatment, 119 patients experienced 1 or more infectious, noninfectious, or serious adverse events, including 37 among those with an excellent response, 36 with an intermediate response, and 46 with a poor response. _	1
Within the first 15 months of treatment, 61 patients discontinued etanercept treatment, including 4 with an excellent response, 0 with an intermediate response, and 57 with a poor response. @	1
In a secondary analysis of 262 patients with a median follow-up of 35.6 months after initiation of etanercept, a range of 37% to 49% of patients reached inactive disease. @	1
The mean adherence to etanercept was 49.2 months (95% CI, 46.4-52.0) for patients with an excellent response after 15 months, 47.5 months (95% CI, 44.9-50.1) for patients with an intermediate response, and 17.4 months (95% CI, 13.6-21.2) for patients with a poor response. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Among patients with JIA who initiated treatment with etanercept, one-third achieved an excellent response, one-third an intermediate response, and one-third a poor response to therapy. @	1
Achievement of an excellent response was associated with low baseline disability scores, DMARDs used before initiating etanercept, and younger age at onset of JIA. @	1
Achievement of a poor treatment response was associated with systemic JIA and female sex. @	1
CONTEXT Since the introduction of biologic therapies, the pharmacological treatment approach for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has changed substantially, with achievement of inactive disease as a realistic goal. `	0
OBJECTIVE To determine the response to therapy after initiation of etanercept therapy among patients with JIA and to examine the association between baseline factors and response to etanercept treatment. `	0
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS The Arthritis and Biologicals in Children Register, an ongoing prospective observational study since 1999, includes all Dutch JIA patients who used biologic agents. `	0
All biologically naive patients who started etanercept before October 2009 were included, with follow-up data to January 2011. `	0
Among the 262 patients, 185 (71%) were female, 46 (18%) had systemic-onset, and the median age at initiation of etanercept treatment was 12.4 years. `	0
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Excellent response (inactive disease or discontinuation earlier due to disease remission), intermediate response (more than 50% improvement from baseline, but no inactive disease), and poor response (less than 50% improvement from baseline or discontinuation earlier due to ineffectiveness or intolerance) evaluated 15 months after initiation of etanercept. _	0
In this paper, we provide the in-depth theoretical analysis needed to understand and properly apply the WCM framework. `	1
We focus on general absorbing sets of type two (GASTs). _	1
In particular, we introduce a novel tree representation of a GAST called the unlabeled GAST tree, using which we prove that the WCM framework is optimal. _	1
Then, we enumerate the WCMs. _	1
We demonstrate the significance of the savings achieved by the WCM framework in the number of matrices processed to remove a GAST. _	1
Moreover, we provide a linear-algebraic analysis of the null spaces of WCMs associated with a GAST. @	1
We derive the minimum number of edge weight changes needed to remove a GAST via its WCMs, along with how to choose these changes. @	1
Additionally, we propose a new set of problematic objects, namely the oscillating sets of type two (OSTs), which contribute to the error floor of NB-LDPC codes with even column weights on asymmetric channels, and we show how to customize the WCM framework to remove OSTs. @	1
We also extend the domain of the WCM framework applications by demonstrating its benefits in optimizing column weight 5 codes, codes used over Flash channels with soft information, and spatially-coupled codes. @	1
The performance gains achieved via the WCM framework range between 1 and nearly 2.5 orders of magnitude in the error floor region over interesting channels. @	1
Non-binary (NB) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are graph-based codes that are increasingly being considered as a powerful error correction tool for modern dense storage devices. `	0
The increasing levels of asymmetry incorporated by the channels underlying modern dense storage systems exacerbates the error floor problem. `	0
In a recent research, the weight consistency matrix (WCM) framework was introduced as an effective NB-LDPC code optimization methodology that is suitable for modern Flash memory and magnetic recording (MR) systems. `	0
We provide an explicit description of this sheaf in terms of the theory of (twisted) Chow-Witt groups as defined by Barge-Morel and developed by Fasel. _	1
We show that, for a smooth proper k-variety X, existence of a rational point up to stable A^1-homotopy is equivalent to existence of a 0-cycle of degree 1. @	1
We study the 0-th stable A^1-homotopy sheaf of a smooth proper variety over a field k assumed to be infinite, perfect and to have characteristic unequal to 2. `	0
We study the notion of rational point up to stable A^1-homotopy, defined in terms of the stable A^1-homotopy sheaf of groups mentioned above. @	0
Cells (passages 1 and 4) were encapsulated in alginate gel beads and cultured in spinner flasks in chondrogenic and chondrocyte growth media. `	1
Subcutaneous implantation of the cell-laden beads was performed to evaluate the ectopic chondrogenesis. `	1
It was found that cells remained viable after 35 days in the three-dimensional dynamic culture. _	1
Passage 1 cells demonstrated a proliferative growth in both media. _	1
Passage 4 cells showed a gradual reduction in DNA content in growth medium, which was attenuated in chondrogenic medium. _	1
Deposition of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was found in all cultures. _	1
While passage 1 cells generally produced higher amounts of GAG than passage 4 cells, GAG/DNA became similar on day 35 for both cells in growth media. @	1
Interestingly, GAG/DNA in growth medium was greater than that in chondrogenic medium for both cells. @	1
Based on GAG quantification and gene expression analysis, encapsulated passage 1 cells cultured in growth medium displayed the best ectopic chondrogenesis. @	1
Cell-based therapy using chondrocytes for cartilage repair suffers from chondrocyte dedifferentiation. `	0
In the present study, the effects of an integrated three-dimensional and dynamic culture on rabbit articular chondrocytes were investigated. `	0
Taken together, the three-dimensional and dynamic culture for chondrocytes holds great potential in cartilage regeneration. @	0
A new formulation for calculating the expected power from a wind turbine in the presence of wind shear, turbulence, directional shear and direction fluctuations is presented. `	1
It is observed that wind shear, directional shear and direction fluctuations reduce the power producing capability, while turbulent intensity increases it. _	1
However, there is a complicated superposition of these effects that alters the characteristics of the power estimate that indicates the need for the new formulation. _	1
Data from two field experiments is used to estimate the wind power using the new formulation, and results are compared to previous formulations. _	1
The spurt of growth in the wind energy industry has led to the development of many new technologies to study this energy resource and improve the efficiency of wind turbines. `	0
One of the key factors in wind farm characterization is the prediction of power output of the wind farm that is a strong function of the turbulence in the wind speed and direction. `	0
Comparison of the estimates of available power from the new formulation is not compared to actual power outputs and will be a subject of future work. @	0

RESULTS Thirty-four VRE-positive cases were identified on 10 wards between February 28, 2005, and May 27, 2005. @	1
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed a single outbreak strain that was also isolated from a video game found on one affected ward. @	1
Multivariate analysis identified cephalosporin use as the major risk factor for VRE colonization. @	1
CONCLUSIONS In the present study outbreak, VRE colonization was significantly associated with cephalosporin use. @	1
Because shared recreational items and environmental surfaces may be colonized by VRE, they warrant particular attention in housekeeping protocols, particularly in pediatric institutions. @	1
BACKGROUND The present study describes a vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) outbreak investigation and a case-control study to identify risk factors for VRE acquisition in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. `	0
OBJECTIVE To report an outbreak investigation and a case-control study to identify risk factors for VRE colonization or infection in hospitalized children. `	0
METHODS Screening for VRE cases was performed by culture or polymerase chain reaction. `	0
A case-control study of VRE-colonized patients was undertaken. _	0
Environmental screening was performed using standard culture and susceptibility methods, with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine relationships between VRE isolates. _	0
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc, USA). _	0
Strong agreement and no differences (M±s.d.DIFF) were found between FMWB and FMSUM (–0.12±0.38 kg, P=0.37; r=0.999, P<0.001); MFLMWB and MFLMSUM (0.02±0.36 kg, P=0.80; r=0.998, P<0.001); and aLMWB and aLMSUM (0.12±0.32 kg, P=0.63; r=0.994, P<0.001). @	1
The objective of this study was to explore the accuracy of summing multiple dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to estimate whole-body soft tissue measures and the sarcopenic index in female subjects for application to an obese population. `	0
Forty-five women who fit within the DXA scanning region (M±s.d. `	0
; BMI=24.5±4.6 kg/m2) were scanned four times (one normal whole body (WB) scan, one head/trunk/leg scan allowing trunk delineation (TRK–H–L), one scan with body shifted right (LA) and one left (RA) to allow arm delineation). _	0
Fat mass (FM) and appendicular lean mass were determined from the WB scan (aLMWB), with the latter determined by summing arm and leg mineral-free lean mass (MFLM). _	0
Summing DXA scans is a valid method for determining the risk for sarcopenic obesity and may aid research regarding obesity and risk for disability. @	0
Functional imaging of a bilateral finger-tapping task showed improved sensitivity for Turbo-CASL as compared to traditional CASL techniques for four of six subjects when scanned at an appropriate repetition time (TR). `	1
Both experimental and simulation results suggest that for optimal functional sensitivity with Turbo-CASL, the pulse TR should be set to a value that is 100-200 ms less than the resting-state TT. _	1
Simulations were also run to demonstrate the differences in TT sensitivity of different slices within a multislice acquisition, and the signal loss that is expected as the number of slices is increased. _	1
Despite the lower baseline ASL signal provided by the Turbo-CASL acquisition, one can achieve equal or improved functional sensitivity due in part to the signal enhancement that accompanies the decrease in TT upon activation. @	1
Turbo-CASL is thus a promising technique for functional ASL at higher temporal resolution. @	1
The optimal use of turbo continuous arterial spin labeling (Turbo-CASL) for functional imaging in the presence of activation-induced transit time (TT) changes was investigated. `	0
We present algorithms to analyze several objectives simultaneously and approximate Pareto curves. _	1
This includes, e.g., several (timed) reachability objectives, or various expected cost objectives. _	1
We also consider combinations thereof, such as on-time-within-budget objectives - which policies guarantee reaching a goal state within a deadline with at least probability $p$ while keeping the allowed average costs below a threshold? @	1
We adopt existing approaches for classical Markov decision processes. @	1
The main challenge is to treat policies exploiting state residence times, even for untimed objectives. @	1
Experimental results show the feasibility and scalability of our approach. @	1
Markov automata combine non-determinism, probabilistic branching, and exponentially distributed delays. `	0
This compositional variant of continuous-time Markov decision processes is used in reliability engineering, performance evaluation and stochastic scheduling. `	0
Their verification so far focused on single objectives such as (timed) reachability, and expected costs. `	0
In practice, often the objectives are mutually dependent and the aim is to reveal trade-offs. _	0
We discuss properties of orbits of (semi)group actions on locally compact groups G. In particular, we show that if a compactly generated locally compact abelian group acts distally on G then the closure of each of its orbits is a minimal closed invariant set (i.e. `	1
the action has [MOC]). _	1
We also show that for such an action distality is preserved if we go modulo any closed normal invariant subgroup and hence [MOC] is also preserved. @	1
We also show that any semigroup action on G has [MOC] if and only if the corresponding actions on a compact invariant metrizable subgroup K and on the quotient space G/K has [MOC]. @	1
Here, we characterize the production of αTP from αT and [γ-32P]-ATP in primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCA-SMC) using separation by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and subsequent analysis by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC). `	1
In addition to αT, although to a lower amount, also γT is phosphorylated. `	1
In THP-1 monocytes, γTP inhibits cell proliferation and reduces CD36 scavenger receptor expression more potently than αTP. _	1
Both αTP and γTP activate the promoter of the human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene with similar potency, whereas αT and γT had no significant effect. _	1
The recombinant human tocopherol associated protein 1 (hTAP1, hSEC14L2) binds both αT and αTP and stimulates phosphorylation of αT possibly by facilitating its transport and presentation to a putative αT kinase. _	1
Recombinant hTAP1 reduces the in vitro activity of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) indicating the formation of a stalled/inactive hTAP1/PI3Kγ heterodimer. @	1
The addition of αT, βT, γT, δT or αTP differentially stimulates PI3Kγ, suggesting facilitated egress of sequestered PI from hTAP1 to the enzyme. @	1
It is suggested that the continuous competitive exchange of different lipophilic ligands in hTAPs with cell enzymes and membranes may be a way to make these lipophiles more accessible as substrates for enzymes and as components of specific membrane domains. @	1
The vitamin E derivative, alpha-tocopheryl phosphate (αTP), is detectable in cultured cells, plasma and tissues in small amounts, suggesting the existence of enzyme(s) with α-tocopherol (αT) kinase activity. `	0
The focus of this study was to review the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules, to discuss the current role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography, addressing its accuracy and cost-effectiveness, and to detail the current recommendations for the examination in this scenario. @	1
A solitary pulmonary nodule is a common, often incidental, radiographic finding. `	0
The investigation and differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules remain complex, because there are overlaps between the characteristics of benign and malignant processes. _	0
There are currently many strategies for evaluating solitary pulmonary nodules. @	0
The main objective is to identify benign lesions, in order to avoid exposing patients to the risks of invasive methods, and to detect cases of lung cancer accurately, in order to avoid delaying potentially curative treatment. @	0
To combine efficient analyses of meiotic chromosome structure and function in a single organism, we have extended to yeast methods for making spread preparations of nuclei. _	1
Features of yeast meiosis that parallel meiosis in large eukaryotes, such as bouquet formation and prophase chromosome condensation that occurs in concert with synaptonemal complex formation, are evident for the first time. @	1
Chromosome behavior in meiosis is well characterized from cytological and genetic descriptions but little is known of the underlying molecular mechanisms, largely because no one experimental system has been developed to support an integrated application of modern cytological, genetic, and molecular biological methods. `	0
The ability to analyze large numbers of nuclei at the light and electron microscopes in preparations amenable to a variety of cytological and immunocytological techniques will facilitate the description of meiosis at the molecular level in yeast. @	0
In this paper, we increase the number of attacked initialization rounds by improving the time complexity of computing cube and we show attacks that go beyond this bound. @	1
We were able to find linear superpoly up to 784 rounds, which leads to an attack requiring 2 39 queries. @	1
Using quadratic superpoly, we were also able to provide another attack up to 799 rounds which complexity is 2 40 queries and 262 for the exhaustive search part. @	1
To achieve such results, we find a way to reduce the density of the polynomials, we look for quadratic relations and we extensively use the Moebius transform to speed up computations for various purposes. @	1
Abstract. `	0
Dinur and Shamir have described cube attacks at EUROCRYPT '09 and they have shown how efficient they are on the stream cipher Trivium up to 767 rounds. `	0
These attacks have been extended to distinguishers but since this seminal work, no better results on the complexity of key recovery attacks on Trivium have been presented. _	0
It appears that the time complexity to compute cubes is expensive and the discovery of linear superpoly also requires the computation of many cubes. _	0
RESULTS At current coverage, Options B and B+ reduced heterosexual HIV incidence by about 5% and 15%, respectively, in both countries. _	1
With current ART and high PMTCT coverage, Option B+ reduced HIV incidence by 35% in Uganda and 19% in South Africa, while Option B had smaller, but meaningful, reductions. @	1
The greatest reductions in HIV incidence were achieved with high ART and PMTCT coverage. @	1
In this scenario, all PMTCT strategies yielded similar results. @	1
DISCUSSION Implementation of Options B/B+ reduces adult HIV incidence, with greater effect (relative to Option A at current levels) in Uganda than South Africa. @	1
These results are likely driven by Uganda's higher fertility rates. @	1
INTRODUCTION Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) strategies include combined short-course antiretrovirals during pregnancy (Option A), triple-drug antiretroviral treament (ART) during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Option B), or lifelong ART (Option B+). `	0
The WHO also recommends ART for HIV treatment and prevention of sexual transmission of HIV. `	0
The impact of PMTCT strategies on prevention of sexual HIV transmission of HIV is not known. `	0
We estimated the population-level impact of PMTCT interventions on heterosexual HIV transmission in southwestern Uganda and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, two regions with different HIV prevalence and fertility rates. `	0
MATERIALS AND METHODS We constructed and validated dynamic, stochastic, network-based HIV transmission models for each region. _	0
PMTCT Options A, B, and B+ were simulated over ten years under three scenarios: 1) current ART and PMTCT coverage, 2) current ART and high PMTCT coverage, and 3) high ART and PMTCT coverage. _	0
We compared adult HIV incidence after ten years of each intervention to Option A (and current ART) at current coverage. _	0

The purpose of this brief communication is to highlight emerging evidence to existing guidelines regarding potential benefits of supporting early, rather than delayed, peanut introduction during the period of complementary food introduction in infants. `	0

Inspired by that, this paper proposes a learning approach to recognize low-resolution faces via selective knowledge distillation. _	1
In this approach, a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) is first initialized to recognize high-resolution faces and resolution-degraded faces with a teacher stream and a student stream, respectively. _	1
The teacher stream is represented by a complex CNN for high-accuracy recognition, and the student stream is represented by a much simpler CNN for low-complexity recognition. @	1
To avoid significant performance drop at the student stream, we then selectively distil the most informative facial features from the teacher stream by solving a sparse graph optimization problem, which are then used to regularize the fine-tuning process of the student stream. @	1
In this way, the student stream is actually trained by simultaneously handling two tasks with limited computational resources: approximating the most informative facial cues via feature regression, and recovering the missing facial cues via low-resolution face classification. @	1
Experimental results show that the student stream performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution faces and costs only 0.15MB memory and runs at 418 faces per second on CPU and 9,433 faces per second on GPU. @	1
Typically, the deployment of face recognition models in the wild needs to identify low-resolution faces with extremely low computational cost. `	0
To address this problem, a feasible solution is compressing a complex face model to achieve higher speed and lower memory at the cost of minimal performance drop. `	0
Results of previous international projects (STORM, SPHERE, AMPHORE, RI- NAMED and MEDEX), as well as information provided by FLASH Project partners and data included in scientific pa- pers were the main source used in building this database. @	1
All the above information had been dispersed in various places, and an attempt was made here to create, for the first time, a verified and complete single database for the entire Mediter- ranean region. @	1
The work analyses the spatial and temporal distribution of flood events, as well as their social impact, with special attention to certain case studies that have been analysed in detail. @	1
This paper contains a preliminary analysis of flood risk in Mediterranean countries, conducted within the frame- work of the FLASH European Project. `	0
All flood events recorded between 1990 and 2006 in the Mediterranean re- gion have been included in the study. _	0
A Palatini-type action for Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity with non-trivial torsion is proposed. `	1
Three-form flux is incorporated via a deformation of the Riemann tensor, and consistency of the Palatini variational principle requires the flux to be covariantly constant and to satisfy a Jacobi identity. _	1
Studying gravity actions of third order in the curvature leads to a conjecture about general Palatini-Lovelock-Cartan gravity. @	1
We point out potential relations to string-theoretic Bianchi identities and, using the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, derive a set of Bianchi identities for the non-geometric Q- and R-fluxes which include derivative and curvature terms. @	1
Finally, the problem of relating torsional gravity to higher-order corrections of the bosonic string-effective action is revisited. @	1
Here, we investigate the role of PDGF signaling in ophthalmic trigeminal placode induction. _	1
By in situ hybridization, PDGF receptor beta is expressed in the cranial ectoderm at the time of trigeminal placode formation, with the ligand PDGFD expressed in the midbrain neural folds. _	1
Blocking PDGF signaling in vitro results in a dose-dependent abrogation of Pax3 expression in recombinants of quail ectoderm with chick neural tube that recapitulate placode induction. @	1
In ovo microinjection of PDGF inhibitor causes a similar loss of Pax3 as well as the later placodal marker, CD151, and failure of neuronal differentiation. @	1
Conversely, microinjection of exogenous PDGFD increases the number of Pax3+ cells in the trigeminal placode and neurons in the condensing ganglia. @	1
Our results provide the first evidence for a signaling pathway involved in ophthalmic (opV) trigeminal placode induction. @	1
Much of the peripheral nervous system of the head is derived from ectodermal thickenings, called placodes, that delaminate or invaginate to form cranial ganglia and sense organs. `	0
The trigeminal ganglion, which arises lateral to the midbrain, forms via interactions between the neural tube and adjacent ectoderm. `	0
This induction triggers expression of Pax3, ingression of placode cells and their differentiation into neurons. `	0
However, the molecular nature of the underlying signals remains unknown. _	0
TARGet Kids!, the only child health research network embedded in primary care practices in Canada, leverages the unique relationship between children and families and their trusted primary care practitioners, with whom they have at least seven health supervision visits in the first 5 years of life. _	1
Children are enrolled during regularly scheduled well-child visits. _	1
To date, we have enrolled 5062 children. _	1
In addition to demographic information, we collect physical measurements (e.g. @	1
height, weight), lifestyle factors (nutrition, screen time and physical activity), child behaviour and developmental screening and a blood sample (providing measures of cardiometabolic, iron and vitamin D status, and trace metals). @	1
All data are collected at each well-child visit: twice a year until age 2 and every year until age 10. @	1
The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) `	0
is an ongoing open longitudinal cohort study enrolling healthy children (from birth to 5 years of age) and following them into adolescence. `	0
The aim of the TARGet Kids! `	0
cohort is to link early life exposures to health problems including obesity, micronutrient deficiencies and developmental problems. `	0
The overarching goal is to improve the health of Canadians by optimizing growth and developmental trajectories through preventive interventions in early childhood. _	0

We describe a C57/Bl6 murine model of Cp lung infection characterized by a dose-dependent, resolving neutrophilia followed by lymphocytic infiltration of the lungs. `	1
By 21 days post-infection, mice exhibit a T helper type 1 (Th1) polarized serum antibody response with local mucosal antibody secretion and organization of ectopic lymphoid tissue which persisted in the absence of detectable Cp DNA. _	1
Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2/CXCL2, which recruits neutrophils and lymphocytes and is associated with ectopic lymphoid tissue formation, was secreted in the lungs post-infection. _	1
In vitro, lung epithelial cells up-regulated MIP-2/CXCL2 in response to both rough lipopolysaccharide (reLPS) and Cp infection. @	1
We conclude that Cp infection can have long-term inflammatory effects on tissue that persist after clearance of active infection. @	1
Infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) accounts for around 10% of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and has been associated with other chronic inflammatory conditions. `	0
RESULTS Hypertension was the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor (39% in women, 41% in men) followed by hypercholesterolemia (38% and 40%) and DM2 (12% and 16%), respectively. _	1
Diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were most often prescribed for hypertension control (<140/90mmHg, achieved in 68% of men and 60% of women treated). _	1
Hypercholesterolemia was controlled (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <130mg/dl) in just 31% of men and 26% of women with no history of cardiovascular disease, despite lipid-lowering treatment, primarily (90%) with statins. @	1
The percentage of women and men with DM2 and with glycated hemoglobin <7% was 64.7% and 59.2%, respectively; treatment was predominantly with oral hypoglycemic agents alone (70%), or combined with insulin (15%). @	1
CONCLUSIONS Hypertension was the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor in the Catalan population attended at primary care centers. @	1
About two thirds of individuals with hypertension or DM2 were adequately controlled; hypercholesterolemia control was particularly low. @	1
OBJECTIVE To analyze the prevalence, control, and management of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). `	0
DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of all individuals attended in the Catalan primary care centers between 2006 and 2009. `	0
LOCATION History of cardiovascular diseases, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, DM2, lipid profile, glycemia and blood pressure data were extracted from electronic medical records. `	0
Age-standardized prevalence and levels of management and control were estimated. `	0
PARTICIPANTS Individuals aged 35-74 years using primary care databases. _	0
MAIN MEASURES A total of 2,174,515 individuals were included (mean age 52 years [SD 11], 47% men). _	0
The risk probability of snail habitats positively correlated with patch fractal dimension (FD), paddy farm land proportion, and wetness index but inversely correlated with categorized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation. _	1
These findings indicate that FD can identify irregular features (e.g., irrigation ditches) in plain regions and that a moderate NDVI increases the microscale risk probability. @	1
Basing on the observed determinants, we predicted a map showing high-risk areas of snail habitats and simulated the effects of conduit hardening and paddy farming land rotation to dry farming land. @	1
The two approaches were confirmed effective for snail control. @	1
These findings provide an empirical basis for health professionals in local schistosomiasis control stations to identify priority areas and promising environmental control strategies for snail control and prevention. @	1
This study aims to identify the landscape ecological determinants related to Oncomelania hupensis distribution, map the potential high risk of O. hupensis habitats at the microscale, and assess the effects of two environmental control strategies. `	0
Sampling was performed on 242 snail sites and 726 non-snail sites throughout Qianjiang City, Hubei Province, China. `	0
An integrated approach of landscape pattern analysis coupled with multiple logistic regression modeling was applied to investigate the effects of environmental factors on snail habitats. _	0
Inspired by magnetic impurity considerations some broad classes of Abelian Higgs and Chern--Simons--Higgs BPS vortex equations are derived and analyzed. `	1
RESULTS Centile charts for birthweight for sex and parity groupings were constructed for singleton birth and compared to existing charts used in Scottish hospitals. _	1
CONCLUSION Mean birthweight has been shown to have increased over recent decades. @	1
The differences shown between the new and currently used centiles confirm the need for more up-to-date centiles for birthweight for gestational age. @	1
BACKGROUND Centile charts of birthweight for gestational age are used to identify low birthweight babies. `	0
The charts currently used in Scotland are based on data from the 1970s and require updating given changes in birthweight and in the measurement of gestational age since then. `	0
METHODS Routinely collected data of 100,133 singleton births occurring in Scotland from 1998-2003 were used to construct new centile charts using the LMS method. _	0
RESULTS Global DNA methylation and methylation at H3K9 in zygotes derived from females after low- or high-dosage hormone treatment were unaltered compared to that in controls. _	1
Moreover, DNA methylation at IAP in blastocysts was also unaffected, regardless of hormone dosage. @	1
In contrast, methylation at Line1 decreased when high-dose hormone was administered. @	1
Unexpectedly, expression of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt3L as well as maintenance Dnmt1o in oocytes and zygotes was not disrupted. @	1
CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that defects in embryonic methylation patterns do not originate from the disruption of Dnmt expression. @	1
BACKGROUND Series of epigenetic events happen during preimplantation development. `	0
Therefore assistant reproduction techniques (ART) have the potential to disrupt epigenetic regulation during embryo development. `	0
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether defects in methylation patterns in blastocyst due to superovulation originate from abnormal expression of Dnmts. `	0
METHODS Low- (6 IU) and high- (10 IU) dosage of PMSG was used to stimulate the female mice. `	0
The metaphase II(MII) oocytes, zygotes and blastocyst stage embryos were collected. _	0
Global methylation and methylation at H3K9 in zygote, and methylation at repeated sequence Line 1 and IAP in blastocysts were assayed. _	0
In addition, expression of Dnmts was examined in oocytes and zygotes. _	0
A reproducible, simple method for assessing nitrogenase activity by the acetylene reduction test on agar plates is described. `	1
The effects of phosphate, succinate and arabinose on nitrogenase activity and slime production by R. japonicum strain 61-A-101, growing on a solid medium with leucine or glutamine as sole source of fixed nitrogen, were investigated. _	1
Slime production varied with different media but there was no simple correlation between slime production and high nitrogenase activity. @	1
Arabinose greatly enhanced nitrogenase activity of bacteria growing on glutamine as sole nitrogen source, especially if the amino acid concentration was 1 mM or less. @	1
Without arabinose, the optimum concentration of glutamine for nitrogenase activity was 2 to 2.5 mM, but 1 mM-glutamine plus 50 mM-arabinose gave twice the activity [8 to 10 nmol ethylene produced h-1 (mg protein)-1]. @	1
A collection of 48 clinical Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from Croatia was investigated retrospectively using in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing and molecular biological techniques to determine mating type and serotype by PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping. `	1
Serotype A (genotype AFLP1) and serotype D (genotype AFLP2) were both found in six patients (40 % each), and serotype AD (genotype AFLP3) in three (20.0 %) patients. @	1
Mating type α (n = 12; 80.0 %) predominated and α/a hybrids were identified in 20.0 % of patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis. @	1
The in vitro antifungal MIC(90) and susceptibility ranges for C. neoformans isolates were 0.5 µg ml(-1) (range 0.031-0.5 µg ml(-1)) for amphotericin B, 4 µg ml(-1) (range 1-4 µg ml(-1)) for flucytosine and fluconazole, 0.25 µg ml(-1) (range 0.031-0.5 µg ml(-1)) for itraconazole and 0.062 µg ml(-1) (range 0.031-0.25 µg ml(-1)) for voriconazole. @	1
These isolates were obtained from 15 patients: ten were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative (66.7 %) and five were HIV-positive (33.3 %). `	0
From five patients, only one isolate was available, whilst from the other ten patients, two to 11 isolates were isolated sequentially. _	0
Antifungal susceptibility was tested by a broth microdilution method. _	0
Two AFLP genotypes of C. neoformans were isolated during a single episode from one patient. @	0
We report the mechanistic separation of functional and structural synaptic regulation by neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), using the neuromuscular synapse as a model. `	1
Inhibition of cAMP response element (CRE)–binding protein (CREB)–mediated transcription blocks the enhancement of transmitter release elicited by NT-3, without affecting the synaptic varicosity of the presynaptic terminals. _	1
Further analysis indicates that CREB is activated through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) pathway, rather than the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or cAMP pathway. _	1
In contrast, inhibition of MAPK prevents the NT-3–induced structural, but not functional, changes. @	1
Genetic and imaging experiments indicate that the small GTPase Rap1, but not Ras, acts upstream of MAPK activation by NT-3. @	1
Thus, NT-3 initiates parallel structural and functional modifications of synapses through the Rap1–MAPK and CaMKIV–CREB pathways, respectively. @	1
The mechanisms by which neurotrophins elicit long-term structural and functional changes of synapses are not known. `	0
These findings may have implications in the general mechanisms of long-term synaptic modulation by neurotrophins. @	0
In this study, a new feature representation was pro-posed by combining position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and auto covariance (AC). `	1
The AC variables describe the neighboring effect between two amino acids, so that they incorpo-rate the sequence-order information; PSSM de-scribes the information of biological evolution of proteins. _	1
Based on this new descriptor, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built to predict subnuclear localization. _	1
The total jackknife cross validation ac-curacy of our method is 76.5%, that is higher than those of the Nuc-PLoc (67.4%), the OET- KNN (55.6%), AAC based SVM (48.9%) and ProtLoc (36.6%). @	1
The prediction software used in this article and the details of the SVM parameters are freely available at http://chemlab.scu.edu.cn/ predict_SubNL/index.htm and the dataset used in our study is from Shen and Chou’s work by downloading at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/ bioinf/Nuc-PLoc/Data.htm. @	1
The knowledge of subnuclear localization in eukaryotic cells is indispensable for under-standing the biological function of nucleus, genome regulation and drug discovery. `	0
To evaluate the power of our predictor, the benchmark dataset that contains 714 proteins localized in nine subnuclear compartments was utilized. @	0
We report a novel class of glutathione S-transferase (GST) from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (sll1545) which catalyzes the detoxification of the water pollutant dichloroacetate and also shows strong glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity representing the classical activities of zeta and theta/alpha class respectively. `	1
Interestingly, sll1545 has very low sequence and structural similarity with these classes. _	1
This is the first report of dichloroacetate degradation activity by any bacterial GST. @	1
Based on these results we classify sll1545 to a novel GST class, rho. @	1
The present data also indicate potential biotechnological and industrial applications of cyanobacterial GST in dichloroacetate-polluted areas. @	0
Building on previous work in Drosophila melanogaster visual learning, we have developed an experimental methodology in which combinations of visual stimuli (colors and patterns) can be arranged such that the same stimuli can either be directly predictive, indirectly predictive, or nonpredictive of punishment. _	1
Varying this relationship, we found that wild-type flies can establish different memory templates for the same contextual color cues. _	1
The colors can either leave no trace in the pattern memory template, leading to context-independent pattern memory (context generalization), or be learned as a higher-order cue indicating the nature of the pattern-heat contingency leading to context-dependent memory (occasion setting) or serve as a conditioned stimulus predicting the punishment directly (simple conditioning). _	1
In transgenic flies with compromised mushroom-body function, the sensitivity to these subtle variations is altered. @	1
Our methodology constitutes a new concept for designing learning experiments. @	1
Our findings suggest that the insect mushroom bodies stabilize visual memories against context changes and are not required for cognition-like higher-order learning. @	1
In a permanently changing environment, it is by no means an easy task to distinguish potentially important events from negligible ones. `	0
Yet, to survive, every animal has to continuously face that challenge. `	0
How does the brain accomplish this feat? `	0
The different stages of MHC class II-interactions with molecular chaperons involved in folding and traffic from the ER through the antigen-loading compartments, peptide exchange, and transport to the cell surface have been investigated. @	1
Through intense research on biophysical and biochemical properties of MHC class II molecules, we have learned that the conformational heterogeneity of MHC class II induced upon binding to different peptides is a key regulator in antigen presentation and epitope selection, and a determinant of the ability of MHC class II to participate in peptide association or dissociation and interaction with the peptide editor HLA-DM. @	1
T cells bearing alphabeta receptors recognize antigenic peptides bound to class I and class II glycoproteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). `	0
Cytotoxic and helper T cells respond respectively to peptide antigens derived from endogenous sources presented by MHC class I, and exogenous sources presented by MHC II, on antigen presenting cells. `	0
Differences in the MHC class I and class II structures and their maturation pathways have evolved to optimize antigen presentation to their respective T cells. _	0
A main focus of our laboratory is on efforts to understand molecular events in processing of antigen for presentation by MHC class II. _	0
METHODS The SCN of mice were destroyed by bilateral electrolytic lesions, and body activity and body temperature were recorded with a radio transmitter implanted into the peritoneal cavity. `	1
Plasma corticosterone levels and circulating lymphocyte counts were measured (n = 75 with SCN lesions, n = 64 sham-operated). `	1
Complete SCN destruction was ascertained postmortem. _	1
RESULTS The 24-hour rest-activity cycle was ablated and the daily rhythms of serum corticosterone level and lymphocyte count were markedly altered in 75 mice with complete SCN destruction as compared with 64 sham-operated mice (two-way ANOVA for corticosterone: sampling time effect P<.001, lesion effect P =.001, and time x lesion interaction P<.001; for lymphocytes P =.001,.002, and.002 respectively). @	1
Body temperature rhythm was suppressed in 60 of the 75 mice with SCN lesions (P<.001). @	1
Both types of tumors grew two to three times faster in mice with SCN lesions than in sham-operated mice (two-way ANOVA: P<.001 for lesion and for tumor effects; P =.21 for lesion x tumor effect interaction). @	1
Survival of mice with SCN lesions was statistically significantly shorter compared with that of sham-operated mice (log-rank P =.0062). @	1
CONCLUSIONS Disruption of circadian rhythms in mice was associated with accelerated growth of malignant tumors of two types, suggesting that the host circadian clock may play an important role in endogenous control of tumor progression. @	1
BACKGROUND The circadian timing system controlled by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus regulates daily rhythms of motor activity and adrenocortical secretion. `	0
An alteration in these rhythms is associated with poor survival of patients with metastatic colorectal or breast cancer. `	0
We developed a mouse model to investigate the consequences of severe circadian dysfunction upon tumor growth. `	0
Mice were inoculated with implants of Glasgow osteosarcoma (n = 16 with SCN lesions, n = 12 sham-operated) or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 13 with SCN lesions, n = 13 sham-operated) tumors to determine the effects of altered circadian rhythms on tumor progression. _	0
Time series for body temperature and rest-activity patterns were analyzed by spectral analysis and cosinor analysis. _	0
Parametric data were compared by the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and survival curves with the log-rank test. _	0
All statistical tests were two-sided. _	0
Eye color had a significant effect, the brown-eyed faces being perceived as more trustworthy than the blue-eyed ones. _	1
Geometric morphometrics, however, revealed significant correlations between eye color and face shape. _	1
Thus, face shape likewise had a significant effect on perceived trustworthiness but only for male faces, the effect for female faces not being significant. @	1
To determine whether perception of trustworthiness was being influenced primarily by eye color or by face shape, we recolored the eyes on the same male facial photos and repeated the test procedure. @	1
Eye color now had no effect on perceived trustworthiness. @	1
We concluded that although the brown-eyed faces were perceived as more trustworthy than the blue-eyed ones, it was not brown eye color per se that caused the stronger perception of trustworthiness but rather the facial features associated with brown eyes. @	1
We tested whether eye color influences perception of trustworthiness. `	0
Facial photographs of 40 female and 40 male students were rated for perceived trustworthiness. `	0
We introduce a statistical approach that uses Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data to identify sharing of chromosomal segments between populations and uses the pattern of sharing to reconstruct a detailed colonization scenario. `	1
We apply our model to the SNP data for the 53 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Project described in Conrad et al. _	1
Our results are consistent with the consensus view of a single "Out-of-Africa" bottleneck and serial dilution of diversity during global colonization, including a prominent East Asian bottleneck. @	1
They also suggest novel details including: (1) the most northerly East Asian population in the sample (Yakut) has received a significant genetic contribution from the ancestors of the most northerly European one (Orcadian). @	1
(2) Native North [corrected] Americans have received ancestry from a source closely related to modern North-East Asians (Mongolians and Oroquen) that is distinct from the sources for native South [corrected] Americans, implying multiple waves of migration into the Americas. @	1
Genome-wide scans of genetic variation can potentially provide detailed information on how modern humans colonized the world but require new methods of analysis. `	0

This paper proposes a procedure for collaborative ethnography to study knowledge work practices and inform IS requirements gathering and design illustrated with the case of a collaborative ethnographic study of seven organisations in four European countries performed in a large-scale international IS research and development project. @	1
The paper also critically discusses the procedure’s applicability and limitations. @	1
Understanding knowledge work and supporting it with information systems (ISs) are challenging tasks. `	0
Knowledge work has changed substantially recently and studies on how knowledge work is currently performed are scarce. `	0
Ethnography is the most suitable qualitative research method for studying knowledge work, yet too time-consuming, costly and unfocused for the fast changing IS domain. _	0
Moreover, results from qualitative studies need to be transformed into artefacts useful for IS requirements engineering and design. _	0
Likewise, a wide range of cold deacclimation behavior was found. _	1
Some species showed as low a loss of 20% of their freezing tolerance, others showed as much as >60% loss after 12 hours of deacclimation. @	1
Significant deacclimation was observed in all cold acclimating species after 1 day. @	1
These results demonstrate that the rates of cold acclimation and deacclimation were not necessarily related to the cold acclimation capacity of a species. @	1
Rapid acclimation in response to low temperatures preceding a frost episode and slow deacclimation in response to unseasonably warm daytime temperatures could be advantageous for plants to survive frost events. @	1
Thus, in addition to nonacclimated freezing tolerance and acclimation capacity, it would be very desirable to be able to select for rapid acclimation and slow deacclimation abilities. @	1
Results demonstrate that variability for these two traits exists in Solanum L. (potato) species. @	1
ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS. `	0
Solanum species, cold acclimation, cold deacclimation ABSTRACT. `	0
Two major components of frost resistance are freezing tolerance in the nonacclimated state (growing in normal condition) and capacity to cold acclimate (increase in freezing tolerance upon exposure to chilling temperatures). `	0
In addition to these two major components, numerous factors contribute to frost survival. `	0
Although the rate of cold acclimation and deacclimation have been recognized as important factors contributing to frost survival, very little information about them is available. _	0
Our objective was to determine if there is variability in the rate of cold acclimation and deacclimation among tuber-bearing wild potato species: S. acaule Bitter, S. commersonii Dunal, S. megistacrolobum Bitter, S. multidissectum Hawkes, S. polytrichon Rydb., S. sanctae-rosae Hawkes, and S. megistacrolobum subsp. _	0

To test this concept, a small molecule inhibitor of CREB, XX-650-23, was developed. _	1
This molecule blocks a critical interaction between CREB and its required co-activator CBP (CREB Binding Protein), leading to disruption of CREB-driven gene expression. _	1
Inhibition of CBP-CREB interaction induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in AML cells, and prolonged survival in vivo in mice injected with human AML cells. @	1
XX-650-23 had little toxicity on normal human hematopoietic cells and tissues in mice. @	1
To understand the mechanism of XX-650-23, we performed RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Cytometry Time of Flight with human AML cells. @	1
Our results demonstrate that small molecule inhibition of CBP-CREB interaction mostly affects apoptotic, cell-cycle and survival pathways, which may represent a novel approach for AML therapy. @	1
The transcription factor CREB (cAMP Response-Element Binding Protein) is overexpressed in the majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and this is associated with a worse prognosis. `	0
Previous work revealed that CREB overexpression augmented AML cell growth, while CREB knockdown disrupted key AML cell functions in vitro. `	0
In contrast, CREB knockdown had no effect on long-term hematopoietic stem cell activity in mouse transduction/transplantation assays. `	0
Together, these studies position CREB as a promising drug target for AML. _	0
The main objective of this work was to assess the effect of different agricultural management practices on soil microbial community structure (evaluated as abundance of phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA). @	1
Five different treatments were selected, based on the most common practices used by farmers in the study area (eastern Spain): residual herbicides, tillage, tillage with oats and oats straw mulching; these agricultural practices were evaluated against an abandoned land after farming and an adjacent long term wild forest coverage. @	1
AbstractAgricultural practices have proven to be unsuitable in many cases, causing considerable reductions in soil quality. `	0
Land management practices can provide solutions to this problem and contribute to get a sustainable agriculture model. _	0
DNA synthesis and cells in S phase analysed by flow cytometry, correlated with strong inhibition of Cdk1 and cyclin E levels, are strongly reduced after exposure to the MEK inhibitor, U0126. _	1
We obtained a significant reduction of colony formation in soft agar assays and a reduction in the size of tumor xenografts in nude mice treated with U0126. @	1
Then, we could specifically abolished ERK1 or 2 expression by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and demonstrated that ERK2 knockdown but not ERK1 interferes with the process of replication. @	1
Moreover, we found that colony formation and tumor growth in vivo were significantly inhibited by targeting ERK2 using stable chemically modified siRNA. @	1
Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of the MEK/ERK pathway in liver cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and argue for a crucial role of ERK2 in this regulation. @	1
The MAPK MEK/ERK pathway is often upregulated in cancer cells and represents an attractive target for development of anticancer drugs. `	0
Only few data concerning the specific functions of ERK1 and 2 are reported in the literature. `	0
In this report, we investigated the specific role of ERK1 and 2 in liver tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. _	0
Our results indicated that persistence of protective antibody prevents reinfection during the following season and may prevent the recrudescence of infectious virus in chronically infected birds. @	1
Abstract Antibody titers against St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) measured by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) decreased rapidly in house finches (Capodacus mexicanus) after initial infection, whereas antibodies measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) remained detectable in all birds for the length of the experiment, indicating long-term persistence and greater assay sensitivity of the EIA. `	0
After 52 wk, birds were challenged by subcutaneous inoculation with the same strain of SLE virus. `	0
Virus was not detected for 1–4 d postchallenge in blood samples tested by plaque assay and RT-PCR or by xenodiagnosis in Culex tarsalis fed concurrently and then held for 11 d at 26°C. _	0
Virus was detected by all three methods in control birds infected concurrently for the first time. _	0
Challenge with SLE produced a rapid and marked ananmestic rise in both neutralizing and EIA antibody titers that exceeded the primary response in the same birds or in concurrently inoculated control birds. @	0
At necropsy 4 wk postchallenge, 3 of 7 challenged and 1of 2 positive control birds were chronically infected, with viral RNA detected by RT-PCR in brain, spleen, lung, and/or kidney tissues. @	0
All groups of participants showed a similar pattern of performance across conditions although children had higher thresholds than adult participants overall. @	1
We consider various explanations for the pattern of performance obtained, including enhanced sensitivity for shearing motions and reduced sensitivity for discriminating different directions. @	1
Our results demonstrate that the speed discrimination judgments of typically developing children and children with autism are similarly affected by spatial configuration as those of typical adults and provide further evidence that speed discrimination is unimpaired in children with autism. @	1
Adult observers show elevated speed discrimination thresholds when comparing the speeds of objects moving across a boundary compared to those moving parallel to a boundary (Verghese & McKee, 2006)-an effect that has been attributed to grouping processes in conjunction with a prior for smooth motion. `	0
Here, we extended Verghese and McKee's (2006) paradigm to typically developing children (n = 35) and children with autism (n = 26) and compared their performance with that of typical adults (n = 19). `	0
Speed discrimination thresholds were measured in three conditions: (a) with dots moving parallel to a boundary, (b) with dots moving perpendicular to a boundary, and (c) with dots in each stimulus half moving in orthogonal, oblique directions. _	0
As expected, participants had higher speed discrimination thresholds when dots appeared to cross a boundary compared to when dots moved parallel to the boundary. _	0
However, participants had even higher thresholds when dots moved in oblique, orthogonal directions, where grouping should be minimal. @	0
SIL treatment restored the mtDNA-encoded gene expression and complex I (but not complex II) dependent ADP-coupled respiration, and established the oxidant/antioxidant balance in chagasic myocardium. @	1
In vitro studies in cardiomyocytes verified that SIL conserved the redox metabolic state and cellular health via maintaining the antioxidant status that otherwise was compromised in response to Tc infection. @	1
CONCLUSION SIL therapy was useful in controlling the LV dysfunction and chronic pathology in CCM. @	1
BACKGROUND Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCM) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc) infection is prevalent in Latin America and recognized as an emerging infectious heart disease in the US. `	0
The NO-cGMP-PKG1α pathway maintains cardiac homeostasis and inotropy and may be disturbed due to phosphodiesterase (PDE5) mediated cGMP catabolism in CCM. `	0
METHODS AND RESULTS C57BL/6 mice were infected with Tc, and at the end of acute parasitemia (i.e. `	0
45 days post-infection), treated with sildenafil (SIL, 1 mg/kg) twice per week for 3 weeks. `	0
Mice were monitored at 150 days post-infection corresponding to chronic disease phase. _	0
The cGMP/PKG activity was decreased by 2-fold and PDE5 expression was increased by 1.4-fold and 100% at RNA and protein levels, respectively, in chagasic myocardium. _	0
Transthoracic echocardiography showed the left ventricular (LV) systolic function, i.e., stroke volume, cardiac output, and ejection fraction, were significantly decreased in chagasic mice. _	0
Sildenafil treatment resulted in normal levels of PDE5 and cGMP/PKG activity and preserved the LV function in chagasic mice. _	0
The cardioprotective effects of SIL were provided through inhibition of cardiac collagenosis and chronic inflammation that otherwise were pronounced in CCM. @	0
Further, mtDNA-encoded gene expression and ADP-coupled mitochondrial respiration were decreased and mitochondrial oxidative stress and cellular oxidative damage (lipid hydroperoxides and protein carbonyls) were increased in chagasic myocardium. @	0
Hepatic transcriptome analyses indicated that compared with 20% CR, 30% CR significantly modulated more than twice the number of genes and 40% CR more than seven times the number of genes. @	1
Many of the genes specific to the 40% CR regimen were hepatic stress-related and/or DNA damage-related genes. @	1
Exogenous IGF-1 rescued the hepatic expression of several metabolic genes and pathways affected by CR. @	1
Exogenous IGF-1 also rescued the expression of several metabolism- and cancer-related genes affected by CR in the mammary gland. @	1
Furthermore, exogenous IGF-1 partially reversed the mammary tumor inhibitory effects of 30% CR. @	1
We conclude that several genes and pathways, particularly those associated with macronutrient and steroid hormone metabolism, are associated with the anticancer effects of CR, and that reduced IGF-1 levels can account, at least in part, for many of the effects of CR on gene expression and mammary tumor burden. @	1
The prevalence of obesity, an established risk and progression factor for breast and many other cancer types, remains very high in the United States and throughout the world. `	0
Calorie restriction (CR), a reduced-calorie dietary regimen typically involving a 20-40% reduction in calorie consumption, prevents or reverses obesity, and inhibits mammary and other types of cancer in multiple tumor model systems. `	0
Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying the tumor inhibitory effects of CR are poorly understood, and a better understanding of these mechanisms may lead to new intervention targets and strategies for preventing or controlling cancer. `	0
We have previously shown that the anticancer effects of CR are associated with decreased systemic levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), the primary source of which is liver. `	0
We have also reported that CR strongly suppresses tumor development and growth in multiple mammary cancer models. _	0
To identify CR-responsive genes and pathways, and to further characterize the role of IGF-1 as a mediator of the anticancer effects of CR, we assessed hepatic and mammary gland gene expression, hormone levels and growth of orthotopically transplanted mammary tumors in control and CR mice with and without exogenous IGF-1. _	0
C57BL/6 mice were fed either control AIN-76A diet ad libitum (AL), subjected to 20%, 30%, or 40% CR plus placebo timed-release pellets, or subjected to 30% or 40% CR plus timed-release pellets delivering murine IGF-1 (mIGF-1, 20 μg/day). _	0
Compared with AL-fed controls, body weights were decreased 14.3% in the 20% CR group, 18.5% in the 30% CR group, and 38% in the 40% CR group; IGF-1 infusion had no effect on body weight. _	0
Evaluation of bendiocarb decay showed that the proportion of houses with recommended concentration declined from 96.9%, 93.5% and 76.2% at months one, two, and three post IRS, respectively (p-trend = 0.03). @	1
The rate of decay increased in the fourth and fifth month post spraying with only 55.9% and 26.3% houses meeting the WHO recommendations, respectively. @	1
CONCLUSION IQK is an important tool for assessing IRS coverage and quality of spraying. @	1
The study found adequate coverage of IRS; however, residual life of bendiocarb was observed to be three months. @	1
Results suggest that in order to maintain the recommended concentrations with bendiocarb, a second spray cycle should be carried out after three months. @	1
BACKGROUND Bendiocarb was introduced for the first time for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in Tanzania in 2012 as part of the interim national insecticide resistance management plan. `	0
This move followed reports of increasingly alarming levels of pyrethroid resistance across the country. `	0
This study used the insecticide quantification kit (IQK) to investigate the intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, and decay rate of bendiocarb on different wall surfaces in Kagera region. `	0
METHODS To assess intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, 104 houses were randomly selected out of 161,414 sprayed houses. `	0
A total of 509 samples (218 in Muleba and 291 in Karagwe) were obtained by scraping the insecticide samples from wall surfaces. `	0
To investigate decay rate, 66 houses (36 in Muleba and 30 in Karagwe) were selected and samples were collected monthly for a period of five months. _	0
Laboratory testing of insecticide concentration was done using IQK(TM) [Innovative Vector Control Consortium]. _	0
RESULTS Of the 509 samples, 89.5% met the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended concentration (between 100-400 mg/m(2)) for IRS target dosage. _	0
The proportion of samples meeting WHO standards varied between Karagwe (84.3%) and Muleba (96.3%) (p < 0.001). _	0
Assessment of quality of spraying at house level revealed that Muleba (84.8%) had a significantly higher proportion of households that met the expected target dosage (100-400 mg/m(2)) compared to Karagwe (68.9%) (p < 0.001). _	0
The quality of spraying varied across different wall substrates in both districts. @	0
The residual-based procedure we propose uses the so-called taut string method, which minimizes the number of peaks subject to a tube constraint on the integrated data. @	1
The baseline is identified by combining the result of the taut string with an estimate of the first derivative of the baseline obtained using a weighted smoothing spline. @	1
Finally, each individual peak is expressed as the finite sum of kernels chosen from a parametric family. @	1
We consider data consisting of photon counts of diffracted x-ray radiation as a function of the angle of diffraction. `	0
The problem is to determine the positions, powers and shapes of the relevant peaks. `	0
An additional difficulty is that the power of the peaks is to be measured from a baseline which itself must be identified. _	0
Most methods of de-noising data of this kind do not explicitly take into account the modality of the final estimate. _	0
Here, by our magneto-transport measurements performed on GaAs/AlGaAs high purity Hall bars with two inner contacts we show that incompressible strips formed at the edges result in Hall quantization, even if the bulk is compressible. _	1
Consequently, the relationship between the quantum Hall effect and topological bulk insulator breaks for specific field intervals within the plateaus. @	1
The measurement of conducting bulk, strongly challenges all existing single-particle theories. @	1
Since the experimental realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron system, the interrelation between the conductance quantization and the topological properties of the system has been investigated. `	0
Assuming that the two-dimensional electron system is described by a Bloch Hamiltonian, system is insulating in the bulk of sample throughout the quantum Hall plateau due to a magnetic field induced energy gap. `	0
Meanwhile, the system is conducting at the edges resembling a 2+1 dimensional topological insulator without time-reversal symmetry. _	0
While we demonstrate support for asynchronous origins of ECM Agaricales, the timing of such events appears to have occurred more recently than suggested by the first hypothesis, first during the Cretaceous and later during the Palaeogene. @	1
We are also unable to reject models of rate constancy, which suggests that the diversity of ECM Agaricales is not a consequence of convergent rapid radiations following evolutionary transitions from saprotrophic to ECM habits. @	1
ECM lineages of Agaricales differ not only in age, but also in rates of diversification and rate of substitution at nuclear ribosomal RNA loci. @	1
These results question the biological uniformity of the ECM guild. @	1
The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is the most widespread biotrophic nutritional mode in mushroom-forming fungi. `	0
ECM fungi include, though are not limited to, about 5000 described species of Agaricales from numerous, independently evolved lineages. `	0
Two central hypotheses suggest different explanations for the origin of ECM fungal diversity: (i) dual origins, initially with the Pinaceae in the Jurassic and later with angiosperms during the Late Cretaceous, and (ii) a simultaneous and convergent radiation of ECM lineages in response to cooling climate during the Palaeogene and advancing temperate ECM plant communities. _	0
Neither of these hypotheses is supported here. _	0
A meta-analysis of the risk of skin rash in 21 prospective studies, did not show a significant difference between patients with LTG and other drugs, including placebo, other ADEs or lithium (OR 0.99-2.41). @	1
In 6 respective studies, there was a significantly higher OR in patients with LTG compared with those with non-aromatic AEDs. @	1
However, there was no significant difference in rash risk between patients with LTG and aromatic AEDs. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that LTG significantly increased the risk of developing a skin rash compared to non-aromatic AEDs. @	1
Our results support the need for large prospective population-based studies and clinical trials to determine whether LTG increases the risk of developing a skin rash than compared to other drugs. @	1
PURPOSE We systematically reviewed studies to provide current evidence on the incidence and risk of skin rash in patients with LTG therapy. `	0
METHODS PubMed and Scopus databases, up to 15 March 2014 were searched to identify relevant studies. `	0
Eligible studies included prospective studies, retrospective studies and postmarketing reports, which included data of skin rash in patients with LTG therapy. `	0
RESULTS Forty-one articles met the entry criteria. _	0
A total of 4447 patients with LTG therapy from 26 prospective studies, 2977 patients from 8 retrospective studies, and 26,126 patients from 5/7 postmarketing reports were included. _	0
The overall incidence of skin rash with LTG therapy was 9.98% (444/4447) from prospective studies, 7.19% (214/2977) from retrospective studies, and 2.09% (547/26,126) from postmarketing reports. _	0
Stroke/TIA was related to dementia in women (odds ratio=1.9, 95% CI: 1.2-3.0), but not in men. @	1
Dementia, but not stroke/TIA, was related to 2-year mortality and institutionalisation in logistic regression models. @	1
CONCLUSION dementia was very common in this age group, and related to mortality and institutionalisation. @	1
Stroke/TIA in 97 year olds showed less association with dementia, mortality and institutionalisation than reported in studies of younger elderly populations. @	1
The finding that stroke was not associated with dementia in men needs to be taken cautiously due to the small number of men. @	1
The findings also emphasise that more studies are needed to scrutinise the aetiology of dementia in nonagenarians. @	1
BACKGROUND the number of nonagenarians increases dramatically worldwide. `	0
OBJECTIVES to examine the prevalence of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and dementia, their inter-relationship and their relation to 2-year mortality and institutionalisation in 97 year olds. `	0
METHODS a population-based sample of 97 year olds (n=591) was examined. `	0
Information on stroke/TIA was obtained from self-reports, key informants and hospital discharge registers. `	0
Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria. _	0
RESULTS the response rate was 65%. _	0
The prevalence of dementia was 32.7% in men and 59.3% in women (P<0.001). _	0
The prevalence of stroke/TIA was 21.5% (17.8% in men, 22.3% in women). _	0
CONCLUSION The application of NTG tape increases peripheral circulation in patients with SSc who have distinct circulatory disturbance. @	1
The application of NTG tape may improve peripheral circulatory disturbance in SSc. @	1
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of newly developed nitroglycerine (NTG) tape on the peripheral circulatory disturbance in systemic sclerosis (SSc). `	0
METHODS The finger temperature (FT) of 25 patients with SSc was monitored by thermography before the application of NTG tape to the wrist and one hour afterwards. `	0
To check the placebo effect, the change of FT with placebo tape in six patients who had shown a distinct rise in FT (>2 degrees C) with NTG tape was monitored. `	0
RESULTS Twenty one patients with SSc had a low FT before the application of NTG tape (colder than mean-2SD of normal controls). _	0
FT was significantly raised in patients with SSc after the application of NTG tape (p<0.01). _	0
Patients with low FT showed a distinct rise in FT more often than patients with a normal FT (71% v 0%, p<0.01). _	0
FT was raised with NTG tape more than with placebo tape (4.2 (SD 1.9) degrees C v 2.2 (2.8) degrees C, p<0.05). @	0
We found the qMSP method to be sensitive and specific to differentiate between insulin-producing cells and other tissues with a detection limit of 10 copies in the presence of non-specific genomic DNA background. @	1
We also compared different methods for data analysis and found that the Relative Expression Ratio method is the most robust method since it incorporates both a reference value to normalize day-to-day variability as well as PCR reaction efficiencies to normalize between the methylation-specific and bisulfite-specific components of the calculations. @	1
The assay was applied in the streptozotocin-treated diabetic mouse model and detected a significant increase in circulating beta cell DNA before the rise in blood glucose level. @	1
These results demonstrate that this qMSP assay can be used for monitoring circulating DNA from insulin-producing cells, which will provide the basis for development of assays to detect beta cell destruction in early T1DM. @	1
DNA methylation is a mechanism by which cells control gene expression, and cell-specific genes often exhibit unique patterns of DNA methylation. `	0
We previously reported that the mouse insulin-2 gene (Ins2) promoter has three potential methylation (CpG) sites, all of which are unmethylated in insulin-producing cells but methylated in other tissues. `	0
In this study we examined Ins2 exon 2 and found a similar tissue-specific methylation pattern. `	0
These methylation patterns can differentiate between DNA from insulin-producing beta cells and other tissues. _	0
We hypothesized that damaged beta cells release their DNA into circulation at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and sought to develop a quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) assay for circulating beta cell DNA to monitor the loss of beta cells. _	0
Methylation-specific primers were designed to interrogate two or more CpG in the same assay. _	0
The cloned mouse Ins2 gene was methylated in vitro and used for development of the qMSP assay. @	0
In this study, we show that small CESA compartments (SmaCCs) or microtubule-associated cellulose synthase compartments (MASCs) are critical for fast recovery of CSCs to the plasma membrane after stress is relieved in Arabidopsis thaliana. @	1
This SmaCC/MASC-mediated fast recovery of CSCs is dependent on CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 (CSI1), a protein previously known to represent the link between CSCs and cortical microtubules. @	1
Independently, AP2M, a core component in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, plays a role in the formation of SmaCCs/MASCs. @	1
Together, our study establishes a model in which CSI1-dependent SmaCCs/MASCs are formed through a process that involves endocytosis, which represents an important mechanism for plants to quickly regulate cellulose synthesis under abiotic stress. @	1
Plants are constantly subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses and have evolved complex strategies to cope with these stresses. `	0
For example, plant cells endocytose plasma membrane material under stress and subsequently recycle it back when the stress conditions are relieved. `	0
Cellulose biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process that is performed by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). _	0
However, the regulatory mechanism of cellulose biosynthesis under abiotic stress has not been well explored. _	0
The aim of this review is to present the main findings that have emerged from experiments which used the TMS technique for memory analysis. _	1
Furthermore, we present state-of-the-art evidence supporting a possible use of TMS in the clinic. @	1
Specifically we focus on the treatment of memory deficits in depression and anxiety disorders. @	1
The ability to recall and recognize facts we experienced in the past is based on a complex mechanism in which several cerebral regions are implicated. `	0
Neuroimaging and lesion studies agree in identifying the frontal lobe as a crucial structure for memory processes, and in particular for working memory and episodic memory and their relationships. `	0
Furthermore, with the introduction of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a new way was proposed to investigate the relationships between brain correlates, memory functions and behavior. _	0
They mainly focused on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in memory process. @	0
We proved the submodularity of our objective function and that our problem is asymptotically related to the KL-divergence between the probability density functions that correspond to a document and its summary in a continuous space. _	1
An experiment using a real dataset demonstrated that our method performed better than the existing method based on sentence-level similarity. @	1
In this study, we consider a summarization method using the document level similarity based on embeddings, or distributed representations of words, where we assume that an embedding of each word can represent its “meaning.” We formalize our task as the problem of maximizing a submodular function defined by the negative summation of the nearest neighbors’ distances on embedding distributions, each of which represents a set of word embeddings in a document. `	0
The aim of this paper is to review the current literature on the molecular mechanisms responsible for selective hypodontia in humans and to present a detailed overview of causative genes and syndromes associated with hypodontia. @	1
Tooth agenesis is one of the most common congenital malformations in humans. `	0
Hypodontia can either occur as an isolated condition (non-syndromic hypodontia) or can be associated with a syndrome (syndromic hypodontia), highlighting the heterogeneity of the condition. _	0
Though much progress has been made to identify the developmental basis of tooth formation, knowledge of the etiological basis of inherited tooth loss is still lacking. @	0
To date, the mutation spectra of non-syndromic form of familial and sporadic tooth agenesis in humans have revealed defects in various such genes that encode transcription factors, MSX1 and PAX9 or genes that code for a protein involved in canonical Wnt signaling (AXIN2), and a transmembrane receptor of fibroblast growth factors (FGFR1). @	0
We found that reappraisal was accompanied by reduced arousal and significant modulation of late neural responses. @	1
What is more, higher IA facilitated downregulation of affect and was associated with more pronounced modulation of underlying neural activity. @	1
Therefore, we conclude that IA not only advances the consolidation of somatic markers required for guiding individual behaviour but also creates processing advantages in tasks referring to these bodily markers. @	1
The ability to cognitively regulate emotional responses to aversive events is essential for mental and physical health. `	0
One prerequisite of successful emotion regulation is the awareness of emotional states, which in turn is associated with the awareness of bodily signals [interoceptive awareness (IA)]. `	0
This study investigated the neural dynamics of reappraisal of emotional responses in 28 participants who differed with respect to IA. _	0
Electroencephalography was used to characterize the time course of emotion regulation. _	0
To introduce new negative charges in a channel protein, amino groups of porin from Rhodobacter capsulatus 37b4 were succinylated with succinic anhydride, and the precise extent and sites of succinylations and structures of the succinylporins determined by mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. `	1
Molecular weight and peptide mapping analyses using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry identified selective succinylation of three lysine-epsilon-amino groups (Lys-46, Lys-298, Lys-300) and the N-terminal alpha-amino group. `	1
The structure of a tetra-succinylated porin (TS-porin) was determined to 2.4 A and was generally found unchanged in comparison to native porin to form a trimeric complex. _	1
All succinylated amino groups found in a mono/di-succinylated porin (MS-porin) and a TS-porin are localized at the inner channel surface and are solvent-accessible: Lys-46 is located at the channel constriction site, whereas Lys-298, Lys-300, and the N-terminus are all near the periplasmic entrance of the channel. _	1
The Lys-46 residue at the central constriction loop was modeled as succinyl-lysine from the electron density data and shown to bend toward the periplasmic pore mouth. _	1
The electrical properties of the MS-and TS-porins were determined by reconstitution into black lipid membranes, and showed a negative charge effect on ion transport and an increased cation selectivity through the porin channel. @	1
The properties of a typical general diffusion porin changed to those of a channel that contains point charges near the pore mouth. @	1
The single-channel conductance was no longer a linear function of the bulk aqueous salt concentration. @	1
The substantially higher cation selectivity of the succinylated porins compared with the native protein is consistent with the increase of negatively charged groups introduced. @	1
These results show tertiary structure-selective modification of charged residues as an efficient approach in the structure-function evaluation of ion channels, and X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry as complementary analytical tools for defining precisely the chemically modified structures. @	1
The role of charges near the pore mouth has been discussed in theoretical work about ion channels. `	0
The seed viability and seedling vigour parameters were considerably reduced in all accessions at high relative humidity irrespective of the species. @	1
Storage at intermediate relative humidities caused minimal decline in viability. @	1
All the accessions performed better at relative humidity level of 32% maintaining seed moisture content of 3%. @	1
On analyzing the variability in storage behaviour, B. rapa and B. juncea were better performers than B. napus and Eruca sativa. @	1
The role of relative humidity (RH) while processing and storing seeds of Brassica spp. `	0
and Eruca sativa was investigated by creating different levels of relative humidity, namely, 75%, 50%, 32%, and 11% using different saturated salt solutions and 1% RH using concentrated sulphuric acid. `	0
The variability in seed storage behaviour of different species of Brassica was also evaluated. _	0
The samples were stored at 40 ± 2°C in sealed containers and various physiological parameters were assessed at different intervals up to three months. _	0
We present a very simple, rapid, general and cost-efficient super-resolution imaging method, which can be directly employed in a simple fluorescent imaging system with general fluorophores. `	1
Based on diffusion-assisted Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescent donor molecules that label specific target structures can be stochastically quenched by diffusing acceptor molecules, thereby temporally separating otherwise spatially overlapped fluorescence signals and allowing super-resolution imaging. _	1
The proposed method provides two- to three-fold-enhancement in spatial resolution, a significant optical sectioning property, and favorable temporal resolution in live-cell imaging. _	1
We demonstrate super-resolution live-cell dynamic imaging using general fluorophores in a standard epi-fluorescence microscope with light-emitting diode (LED) illumination. @	1
Despite the recent development of several super-resolution fluorescence microscopic techniques, there are still few techniques that can be readily employed in conventional imaging systems. `	0
Due to the simplicity of this approach, we expect that the proposed method will prove an attractive option for super-resolution imaging. @	0
In particular, we analyze to what extent labor market participation of different groups of women and the hours they work are influenced by human capital and household characteristics. _	1
Our results show some remarkable differences in employment patterns between native Dutch and ethnic minority women. _	1
Controlling for educational level, partnership and the presence of children, native Dutch women are working more often in part time jobs than Mediterranean and Caribbean women. @	1
For all women the educational level is an important determinant of employment and the number of hours worked. @	1
Whereas the number of children influences both the employment decision and the number of hours worked of native Dutch women, for Mediterranean and Caribbean women there is only an effect of the number of children on the odds of having a full time job. @	1
Labor market participation is a central factor in the economic integration of migrants in their host country. `	0
Labor market integration of ethnic minority women is of special interest, as they may experience a double disadvantage: both as a woman and as a migrant. `	0
Since the late nineties this presumed double disadvantage has become more and more the focus of both Dutch integration and Dutch emancipation policy. `	0
To test several assumptions underlying Dutch policy this paper focuses on the employment patterns of ethnic minority and native women in the Netherlands. _	0
We show that the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ contains a measure zero set $N$ such that every Lipschitz function $f\colon \mathbb{H}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is Pansu differentiable at a point of $N$. `	1
The proof adapts the construction of small 'universal differentiability sets' in the Euclidean setting: we find a point of $N$ and a horizontal direction where the directional derivative in horizontal directions is almost locally maximal, then deduce Pansu differentiability at such a point. _	1
The Witten spinorial argument has been adapted in several works over the years to prove positivity of mass in the asymptotically AdS and asymptotically hyperbolic settings in arbitrary dimensions. `	1
In this paper we prove a scalar curvature rigidity result and a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds that do not require a spin assumption. _	1
The positive mass theorem is reduced to the rigidity case by a deformation construction near the conformal boundary. @	0
The proof of the rigidity result is based on a study of minimizers of the BPS brane action. @	0
We propose that strain CC-SPL15-2(T) be assigned to a novel species, with the name Salinicoccus sesuvii sp. @	1
nov. @	1
The type strain is CC-SPL15-2(T) ( = DSM 23267(T)  = CCM 7756(T)). @	1
A Gram-staining-positive coccus, designated CC-SPL15-2(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere of Sesuvium portulacastrum. `	0
By 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, it was shown that strain CC-SPL15-2(T) belonged to the genus Salinicoccus. `	0
The isolate was most closely related to Salinicoccus hispanicus DSM 5352(T) (98.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Salinicoccus roseus DSM 5351(T) (96.7 %); similarities to all other members of the genus Salinicoccus were <96.5 %. `	0
In accordance with characteristics of the genus Salinicoccus, the quinone system was mainly composed of menaquinone MK-6. `	0
The polar lipid profile exhibited the major components diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified glycolipid. _	0
In the polyamine pattern, spermidine was the predominant compound. _	0
The fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0) and anteiso-C(17 : 0), which supported the affiliation of strain CC-SPL15-2(T) to the genus Salinicoccus. _	0
DNA-DNA relatedness between strain CC-SPL15-2(T) and S. hispanicus CCUG 43288(T) was 42 and 32 % (reciprocal analysis). _	0
From these data as well as from physiological and biochemical tests, a clear differentiation of strain CC-SPL15-2(T) from S. hispanicus and other members of the genus Salinicoccus was possible. @	0
OBJECTIVE The authors report on the use of active suture fixation of the brow and advancement of the forehead flap to accomplish a precise, effective, and sustained brow elevation. `	1
METHODS Dissection was carried down to the frontalis muscle with a reversed bevel incision. _	1
Corrugator resection was performed by incising the galea transversely in the glabellar region and then identifying, isolating, and resecting the muscle. _	1
The first PTS was placed to secure the midline subcutaneous tissue to the superior edge of the transected galea. _	1
Then a PTS was placed from the subcutaneous tissue or deep dermis of the flap deep to the anticipated brow peak. _	1
The brow was anchored in an elevated position with additional PTS placed medially and laterally. @	1
RESULTS A consecutive series of 80 patients underwent the described procedure, with average follow-up of 13.5 months. @	1
One case of transient epidermolysis occurred, resulting in a small area of partial alopecia. @	1
Three patients had extruding sutures. @	1
Upper eyelid excision was required in 5 patients, and in 1 patient unilateral revision was performed to improve symmetry. @	1
CONCLUSIONS This approach simplifies the forehead lift and allows the surgeon to directly and precisely control the position of the brows, while shortening convalescence and reducing complications. @	1
BACKGROUND Current aesthetic literature reflects a renewed interest in the subcutaneous brow lift. `	0
The authors believe that this trend is based on the principle that the most direct approach to elevating the brows is subcutaneous dissection with skin advancement. `	0
Furthermore, the addition of progressive tension sutures (PTSs) to the subcutaneous brow lift permits precise fixation of brow position, controlled advancement of the forehead flap, and elimination of dead space. `	0
We thus propose that matching of structural fluctuations is a component of how TCRs scan among potential ligands for those that can bind with sufficient stability to enable T cell signaling. @	1
Although conformational changes in TCRs and peptide Ags presented by MHC protein (pMHC) molecules often occur upon binding, their relationship to intrinsic flexibility and role in ligand selectivity are poorly understood. `	0
In this study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance to study TCR-pMHC binding, examining recognition of the QL9/H-2L(d) complex by the 2C TCR. `	0
Although the majority of the CDR loops of the 2C TCR rigidify upon binding, the CDR3β loop remains mobile within the TCR-pMHC interface. _	0
Remarkably, the region of the QL9 peptide that interfaces with CDR3β is also mobile in the free pMHC and in the TCR-pMHC complex. _	0
Determination of conformational exchange kinetics revealed that the motions of CDR3β and QL9 are closely matched. @	0
The matching of conformational exchange in the free proteins and its persistence in the complex enhances the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the TCR-pMHC complex and provides a mechanism for facile binding. @	0
Results Black-tailed deer was the most common item in occurrence per faeces (63%) and occurrence per item (53%) indices, representing about 63% of mammalian biomass. _	1
Wolves consumed more deer on islands near the mainland (65% occurrence per item) than on the mainland (39%) and outer islands (45%), where other ungulates (mainland only) and small mammals replaced deer. @	1
On islands, the probability of detecting deer was influenced primarily by island distance to mainland (not by area or inter-landmass distance), suggesting limited recolonization by deer from source populations as a causal mechanism. @	1
Main conclusions Although sampling was limited in time, consistent patterns among islands suggest that population dynamics in isolated fragments are less stable and can result in depletion of prey. @	1
Aim Predator‐prey dynamics in fragmented areas may be influenced by spatial features of the landscape. `	0
Although little is known about these processes, an increasingly fragmented planet underscores the urgency to predict its consequences. `	0
Accordingly, our aim was to examine foraging behaviour of an apex mammalian predator, the wolf (Canis lupus), in an archipelago environment. `	0
Location Mainland and adjacent archipelago of British Columbia, Canada; a largely pristine and naturally fragmented landscape with islands of variable size and isolation. `	0
Methods We sampled 30 mainland watersheds and 29 islands for wolf faeces in summers 2000 and 2001 and identified prey remains. _	0
We examined broad geographical patterns and detailed biogeographical variables (area and isolation metrics) as they relate to prey consumed. _	0
For island data, we used Akaike Information Criteria to guide generalized linear regression model selection to predict probability of black-tailed deer (main prey; Odocoileus hemionus )i n faeces. _	0
This may have important implications in understanding predator‐prey communities in isolation, debate regarding wolf‐ deer systems and logging in temperate rain forests, and reserve design. @	0
This article provides a review on ganetespib, a small molecule HSP90 inhibitor that is currently under evaluation in a broad range of cancer types in combination with other therapeutic agents with the hope of further enhancing its efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. @	1
Based on our current understanding of the complex HSP90 machinery combined with the emerging data from these key clinical trials, ganetespib has the potential to be the first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor to be approved as a new anticancer therapy. @	1
Under stressful conditions, the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) molecular chaperone protects cellular proteins (client proteins) from degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. `	0
HSP90 expression is upregulated in cancers, and this contributes to the malignant phenotype of increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis and maintenance of metastatic potential via conservation of its client proteins, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, Akt, Raf-1, cell cycle proteins, and B-cell lymphoma 2 among others. `	0
Hence, inhibition of HSP90 leads to the simultaneous degradation of its many clients, thereby disrupting multiple oncogenic signaling cascades. _	0
This has sparked tremendous interest in the development of HSP90 inhibitors as an innovative anticancer strategy. _	0
Based on the wealth of compelling data from preclinical studies, a number of HSP90 inhibitors have entered into clinical testing. @	0
However, despite enormous promise and anticancer activity reported to date, none of the HSP90 inhibitors in development has been approved for cancer therapy, and the full potential of this class of agents is yet to be realized. @	0
Most of the wing flexure signal appears on the inphase component only, hence the quadrature component should be taken for sea ice thickness retrievals when wing flexure is present even when the inphase produces a larger ocean sig­nal. _	1
Results also show that pitch and roll movements of the aircraft and electromagnetic coupling between seawater and aircraft can contribute significantly to the total noise. _	1
For flight heights of 30 m over the ocean these effects can change the sig­nal by about 10% or more. @	1
For highly quantitative measurements like sea-ice thickness all these effects must be taken into account. @	1
We conclude that a fixed wing electromagnetic instrument for the purpose of measure­ments in a centimeter scale must include instrumentation to measure the relative position of the antenna coils with an accuracy of 1/10 mm. @	1
Furthermore the antenna separation distance should be as large as possible in order to increase the measured ratio of secondary to primary magnetic field strength. @	1
article i nfo In this paper, the noise sources of an airborne electromagnetic frequency domain instrument used to measure sea-ice thickness are studied. `	0
The antennas are mounted on the wings of an aircraft. `	0
The paper presents real data examples showing that strong noise limited the accuracy of the thickness measurement to ± 0.5 m in the best case. `	0
Even drift cor­rection and frequency filtering did not reduce the noise to a level necessary for sea ice thickness measurements with an accuracy of 0.1 m. We show results of 3D finite element modeling of the coupling between transmitter and receiver coils and the aircraft, which indicate that wing flexure is the primary cause of the strong noise. `	0
Wing deflection angles below 5° relative to the fuselage are large enough to cause changes higher than the wanted signal from the seawater under the ice. _	0
Wing flexure noise can be divided into an inductive and geometric contribution, both of the same order. _	0
We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). `	1
The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. _	1
We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. _	1
The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. _	1
We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. @	1
We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. @	1
We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. @	1
With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan. @	1
Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. `	0
Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. `	0
This paper presents the results of a wave hindcast of a severe storm in the Southern North Sea to verify recently developed deep and shallow water source terms. `	1
As a first step in assessing the performance of these newly developed source terms, the source term balance and the effect of different physical settings on the prediction of wave heights and wave periods in the relatively shallow North Sea was analysed. _	1
Results of the wave hindcast were compared with buoy measurements at location K13 collected by the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works. @	1
An analysis was made of the source term balance at three locations, the deep water location North Cormorant, the inter-mediate depth location K13 and at location Wielingen, a shallow water location close to the Dutch coast. @	1
The results indicate that at deep water the source terms for wind input, whitecapping and nonlinear four-wave interactions are of the same magnitude. @	1
At the inter-mediate depth location K13, bottom friction plays a significant role, whereas at the shallow water location Wielingen also depth-limited wave breaking becomes important. @	1
The work was carried out in the framework of the ONR funded NOPP project (Tolman et al. `	0
2013) in which deep and shallow water source terms were developed for use in third-generation wave prediction models. `	0
These deep water source terms for whitecapping, wind input and nonlinear interactions were developed, implemented and tested primarily in the WAVEWATCH III model, whereas shallow water source terms for depth-limited wave breaking and triad interactions were developed, implemented and tested primarily in the SWAN wave model. `	0
So far, the new deep-water source terms for whitecapping were not fully tested in shallow environments. `	0
Similarly, the shallow water source terms were not yet tested in large inter-mediate depth areas like the North Sea. `	0
The December 2013 storm was hindcast with a SWAN model implementation for the North Sea. _	0
Spectral wave boundary conditions were obtained from an Atlantic Ocean WAVEWATCH III model implementation and the model was driven by hourly CFSR wind fields. _	0
In the southern part of the North Sea, current and water level effects were included. _	0
The hindcast was performed with five different settings for whitecapping, viz. _	0
three Komen type whitecapping formulations, the saturation-based whitecapping by Van der Westhuysen et al. _	0
(2007) and the recently developed ST6 whitecapping as described by Zieger et al. @	0
(2015). @	0
Here, we prospectively isolate GFAP(+)CD133(+) (quiescent neural stem cells [qNSCs]) and GFAP(+)CD133(+)EGFR(+) (activated neural stem cells [aNSCs]) from the adult ventricular-subventricular zone. `	1
Transcriptome analysis reveals that qNSCs share features with quiescent stem cells from other organs. @	1
Finally, small-molecule screening identified the GPCR ligands, S1P and PGD2, as factors that actively maintain the quiescent state of qNSCs. @	1
Adult neurogenic niches harbor quiescent neural stem cells; however, their in vivo identity has been elusive. `	0
aNSCs are rapidly cycling, highly neurogenic in vivo, and enriched in colony-forming cells in vitro. `	0
In contrast, qNSCs are largely dormant in vivo, generate olfactory bulb interneurons with slower kinetics, and only rarely form colonies in vitro. _	0
Moreover, qNSCs are Nestin negative, a marker widely used for neural stem cells. _	0
Upon activation, qNSCs upregulate Nestin and EGFR and become highly proliferative. _	0
Notably, qNSCs and aNSCs can interconvert in vitro. @	0
We report here that neurofibromin, a Ras-GAP encoded by Nf1, has an overlapping expression pattern with FGFR1 and FGFR3 in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, and with FGFR1 in hypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. _	1
Histomorphometric and gene expression analyses suggested that neurofibromin, by inhibiting Rankl expression, attenuates pro-osteoclastogenic FGFR1 signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes. @	1
We also provide evidence suggesting that neurofibromin in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, downstream of FGFRs and via an indirect mechanism, is required for normal extension and organization of proliferative columns. @	1
Collectively, this study indicates that FGFR signaling provides an important input into the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling axis in chondrocytes, and that this input is differentially regulated during chondrocyte maturation by a complex intracellular machinery, of which neurofibromin is a critical component. @	1
Aberrant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) signaling disrupts chondrocyte proliferation and growth plate size and architecture, leading to various chondrodysplasias or bone overgrowth. `	0
These observations suggest that the duration, intensity and cellular context of FGFR signaling during growth plate chondrocyte maturation require tight, regulated control for proper bone elongation. `	0
However, the machinery fine-tuning FGFR signaling in chondrocytes is incompletely defined. `	0
Based on previous evidence that neurofibromin inhibits Ras-ERK signaling in chondrocytes and phenotypic analogies between mice with constitutive FGFR1 activation and Nf1 deficiency in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes, we asked whether neurofibromin is required to control FGFR1-Ras-ERK signaling in maturing chondrocytes in vivo. _	0
Genetic Nf1 ablation in Fgfr1-deficient chondrocytes reactivated Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in hypertrophic chondrocytes and reversed the expansion of the hypertrophic zone observed in mice lacking Fgfr1 in Col2a1-positive chondrocytes. _	0
We here describe and discuss our study protocol with regard to the research aims, the local implementation context, and our rationale for selecting a mixed methods explanatory design with a quasi-experimental quantitative component. `	1
DESIGN The quantitative research component consists of a controlled pre- and post-test design with multiple post-test measurements. _	1
This allows us to quantitatively measure 'equitable access to healthcare services' at the community level and 'healthcare quality' at the health facility level. _	1
Guided by a theoretical framework of causal relationships, we determined a number of input, process, and output indicators to evaluate both intended and unintended effects of the intervention. _	1
Overall causal impact estimates will result from a difference-in-difference analysis comparing selected indicators across intervention and control facilities/catchment populations over time.To further explain heterogeneity of quantitatively observed effects and to understand the experiential dimensions of financial incentives on clients and providers, we designed a qualitative component in line with the overall explanatory mixed methods approach. @	1
This component consists of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with providers, service user, non-users, and policy stakeholders. @	1
In this explanatory design comprehensive understanding of expected and unexpected effects of the intervention on both access and quality will emerge through careful triangulation at two levels: across multiple quantitative elements and across quantitative and qualitative elements. @	1
DISCUSSION Combining a traditional quasi-experimental controlled pre- and post-test design with an explanatory mixed methods model permits an additional assessment of organizational and behavioral changes affecting complex processes. @	1
Through this impact evaluation approach, our design will not only create robust evidence measures for the outcome of interest, but also generate insights on how and why the investigated interventions produce certain intended and unintended effects and allows for a more in-depth evaluation approach. @	1
BACKGROUND In this article we present a study design to evaluate the causal impact of providing supply-side performance-based financing incentives in combination with a demand-side cash transfer component on equitable access to and quality of maternal and neonatal healthcare services. `	0
This intervention is introduced to selected emergency obstetric care facilities and catchment area populations in four districts in Malawi. `	0
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE During a half-iron distance triathlon, the capacity of leg muscles to produce force was notably diminished while arm muscle force output remained unaffected. @	1
Leg muscle fatigue was correlated with blood markers of muscle damage suggesting that muscle breakdown is one of the most relevant sources of muscle fatigue during a triathlon. @	1
BACKGROUND To investigate the cause/s of muscle fatigue experienced during a half-iron distance triathlon. `	0
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We recruited 25 trained triathletes (36±7 yr; 75.1±9.8 kg) for the study. `	0
Before and just after the race, jump height and leg muscle power output were measured during a countermovement jump on a force platform to determine leg muscle fatigue. `	0
Body weight, handgrip maximal force and blood and urine samples were also obtained before and after the race. `	0
Blood myoglobin and creatine kinase concentrations were determined as markers of muscle damage. _	0
RESULTS Jump height (from 30.3±5.0 to 23.4±6.4 cm; P<0.05) and leg power output (from 25.6±2.9 to 20.7±4.6 W · kg(-1); P<0.05) were significantly reduced after the race. _	0
However, handgrip maximal force was unaffected by the race (430±59 to 430±62 N). _	0
Mean dehydration after the race was 2.3±1.2% with high inter-individual variability in the responses. _	0
Blood myoglobin and creatine kinase concentration increased to 516±248 µg · L(-1) and 442±204 U · L(-1), respectively (P<0.05) after the race. @	0
Pre- to post-race jump change did not correlate with dehydration (r = 0.16; P>0.05) but significantly correlated with myoglobin concentration (r = 0.65; P<0.001) and creatine kinase concentration (r = 0.54; P<0.001). @	0
The results of this study showed that there was wide variation in the concentration of these metals in vegetables collected from different sites. _	1
Vegetables grown in the vicinity of an industrial area were most contaminated while vegetables grown in rural area were least contaminated. _	1
Analytical results indicated that the concentration of lead in 35% vegetable samples collected from industrial area were more than maximum permitted limit. _	1
The high concentration of cadmium was found in onion and coriander, while lead content was recorded high in spinach and cauliflower. @	1
Arsenic concentration in 25% samples collected from industrial area was more than maximum permitted limit. @	1
Copper concentration in most of the vegetable sample was within permissible limit; only two out of forty samples have high concentration of copper. @	1
The results of the study showed that consumers are at greater risk of purchasing these fresh vegetables with high levels of heavy metals beyond permissible limits as defined by the Indian Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. @	1
The study was conducted to find out the content of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As) and copper (Cu) in some selected vegetables grown in and around Nashik city, Maharashtra state (India). `	0
Vegetable samples from four different sites were collected and digested by using tri-acid digestion method. `	0
Concentrations of heavy metals were analyzed by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. `	0
Results: We demonstrate that S. aureus α-toxin activates the acid sphingomyelinase in ex vivo macrophages and triggers a release of ceramides. _	1
Ceramides induced by S. aureus α-toxin localize to lysosomes and mediate a release of cathepsin B and D from lysosomes into the cytoplasm. _	1
Cytosolic cathepsin B forms a complex with Nlrc4. @	1
Treatment of macrophages with α-toxin induces the formation of IL-1β and TNF-α. @	1
These events are reduced or abrogated, respectively, in cells lacking the acid sphingomyelinase and upon treatment of macrophages with amitriptyline, a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase. @	1
Pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin B prevented activation of the inflammasome measured as release of IL-1β, while the formation of TNF-α was independent of cathepsin B. @	1
Conclusion: We demonstrate a novel mechanism how bacterial toxins activate the inflammasome and mediate the formation and release of cytokines: S. aureus α-toxin triggers an activation of the acid sphingomyelinase and a release of ceramides resulting in the release of lysosomal cathepsin B and formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. @	1
Background/Aims: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections are a major clinical problem and range from mild skin and soft-tissue infections to severe and even lethal infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, and toxic shock syndrome. `	0
Toxins that are released from S. aureus mediate many of these effects. `	0
Here, we aimed to identify molecular mechanisms how α-toxin, a major S. aureus toxin, induces inflammation. `	0
Methods: Macrophages were isolated from the bone marrow of wildtype and acid sphingomyelinase-deficient mice, stimulated with S. aureus α-toxin and activation of the acid sphingomyelinase was quantified. `	0
The subcellular formation of ceramides was determined by confocal microscopy. _	0
Release of cathepsins from lysosomes, activation of inflammasome proteins and formation of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) were analyzed by western blotting, confocal microscopy and ELISA. _	0
Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences placed the strain in the family Thermaceae in the phylum 'Deinococcus-Thermus', which is consistent with the chemotaxonomic data. @	1
On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain 2M70-1(T) ( = JCM 15963(T)  = DSM 22268(T)) represents the type strain of a novel species of a novel genus, for which the name Rhabdothermus arcticus gen. nov., sp. @	1
nov. is proposed. @	1
A novel thermophilic member of the family Thermaceae, designated strain 2M70-1(T), was isolated from the wall of an active white smoker chimney collected in the Soria Moria vent field at 71 °N in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. `	0
Cells of the strain were Gram-negative, non-motile rods. `	0
Growth was observed at 37-75 °C (optimum 65 °C), at pH 6-8 (optimum pH 7.3) and in 1-5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.5-3.5 %). `	0
The isolate was aerobic but could also grow anaerobically using nitrate or elemental sulfur as electron acceptors. `	0
The strain was obligately heterotrophic, growing on complex organic substrates like yeast extract, Casamino acids, tryptone and peptone. _	0
Pyruvate, acetate, butyrate, sucrose, rhamnose and maltodextrin were used as complementary substrates. _	0
The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68 mol%. _	0
Cells possessed characteristic phospholipids and glycolipids. _	0
Major fatty acids constituted saturated and unsaturated iso-branched and saturated anteiso-branched forms. @	0
Menaquinone 8 was the sole respiratory lipoquinone. @	0
This study investigates MGDM with decision information taking the form of I-HFEs and their special cases. _	1
Based on some aggregation operators of I-HFEs, three approaches for distinct scenarios of MGDM are proposed and clarified by a practical problem involved with supplier selection. @	1
Comparisons between the proposed approaches and the existing methods show that the proposed approaches are more rational than those by aggregating the evaluations directly in MGDM. @	1
AbstractMulti-groups decision making (MGDM) problems, which contain multiple groups of experts acting collectively to evaluate a set of alternatives with respect to several criteria, are focused on in this study. `	0
The existing solutions for MGDM are to aggregate the evaluations three times at different levels, which leads to less accuracy and more computational complexities. `	0
Intuitionistic-valued hesitant fuzzy elements (I-HFEs) which consider all possible values instead of aggregation straightforward are flexible to represent the experts' opinions and lessen the steps of aggregations. _	0
In this paper, we examine a new feature, accent ratio, which captures how likely it is that a word will be realized as prominent or not. _	1
AbstractThe immense prosodic variation of natural conversational speech makes it challenging to predict which words are prosodically prominent in this genre. `	0
Observed and Chao-1 estimated species richness, as well as Shannon diversity of wild bees visiting blueberries were significantly higher in Michigan where the crop is within its native range. _	1
The regional bee communities were also significantly different, with Michigan farms having greater dissimilarity than British Columbia. _	1
Blueberry fields in British Columbia had fewer visits by honey bees than those in Michigan, irrespective of stocking rate, and they also had lower berry weights and a significant pollination deficit. _	1
In British Columbia, pollination service increased with abundance of wild bumble bees, whereas in Michigan the abundance of honey bees was the primary predictor of pollination. @	1
The proportion of semi-natural habitat at local and landscape scales was positively correlated with wild bee abundance in both regions. @	1
Wild bee abundance declined significantly with distance from natural borders in Michigan, but not in British Columbia where large-bodied bumble bees dominated the wild bee community. @	1
Our results highlight the varying dependence of crop production on different types of bees and reveal that strategies for pollination improvement in the same crop can vary greatly across production regions. @	1
Highbush blueberry yields are dependent on pollination by bees, and introduction of managed honey bees is the primary strategy used for pollination of this crop. `	0
Complementary pollination services are also provided by wild bees, yet highbush blueberry is increasingly grown in regions outside its native range where wild bee communities may be less adapted to the crop and growers may still be testing appropriate honey bee stocking densities. `	0
To contrast crop pollination in native and non-native production regions, we sampled commercial 'Bluecrop' blueberry fields in British Columbia and Michigan with grower-selected honey bee stocking rates (0-39.5 hives per ha) to compare bee visitors to blueberry flowers, pollination and yield deficits, and how those vary with local- and landscape-scale factors. `	0
The involucrin genes of the dog and the pig have been cloned and sequenced. `	1
Like the corresponding genes of the prosimians, each contains a homologous segment of short tandem repeats at the same position in the coding region. `	0
However, the codon sequence of the repeats in the prosimians differs significantly from that of the nonprimate mammals. _	0
This evolution has been brought about by a combination of genetic modifications (selective deletions, mutations, and gene conversions). _	0
In the anthropoids, this segment of repeats was replaced by a modern one differing in location, sequence, and repeat length. @	0
In several of its properties the modern segment has continued the prosimian trend away from the nonprimates. @	0
The overall direction of the evolution of this segment has therefore been maintained even though there have been sudden changes in the evolutionary processes acting on the gene. @	0
The authors estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression analyses, adjusted for education and tobacco use (snuff use in the smoking analysis and smoking in the snuff analysis). _	1
The risk of acoustic neuroma was greatly reduced in male current smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23, 0.74) and moderately reduced in female current smokers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.23). @	1
In contrast, current snuff use among males was not associated with risk of acoustic neuroma (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.57, 1.55). @	1
The authors' findings are consistent with previous reports of lower acoustic neuroma risk among current cigarette smokers than among never smokers. @	1
The absence of an association between snuff use and acoustic neuroma suggests that some constituent of tobacco smoke other than nicotine may confer protection against acoustic neuroma. @	1
Two previous studies suggest that cigarette smoking reduces acoustic neuroma risk; however, an association between use of snuff tobacco and acoustic neuroma has not been investigated previously. `	0
The authors conducted a case-control study in Sweden from 2002 to 2007, in which 451 cases and 710 population-based controls completed questionnaires. `	0
Cases and controls were matched on gender, region, and age within 5 years. _	0
RESULTS About 48.7% of the clinicians meet the criteria for burnout according to the CBI. @	1
Moreover, in multivariate logistic regression analyses, burnout is significantly associated with perceived quality of care among male (odds ratios vary from 1.5 to 2.6) but not among female surgeons (odds ratios vary from 1.3 to 1.5). @	1
CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of burnout in our study corresponds with former studies of burnout among physicians. @	1
Furthermore, the results of the study suggest a relationship between burnout and perceived quality of care among men. @	1
Thus, reducing burnout among surgeons could not only improve their health and well-being but also the quality of care. @	1
OBJECTIVE Burnout is highly prevalent among clinicians but there is not much known about the association between burnout and quality of care. `	0
In this paper, burnout, perceived quality of care and medical errors among German clinicians in surgery are explored. `	0
DESIGN Data were collected during 2008 by a cross-sectional, standardized mail survey. `	0
PARTICIPANTS and   SETTING A total of 1311 clinicians in surgery in 489 German hospitals. _	0
Measure(s) Burnout was measured by using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). _	0
The measurement of self-rated patient care was based on a 13 item instrument (Chirurgisches Qualitätssiegel) and two questions assessing the frequency of medical errors. _	0
We introduce an entanglement branching operator to split a composite entanglement flow in a tensor network which is a promising theoretical tool for many-body systems. `	1
We can optimize an entanglement branching operator by solving a minimization problem based on squeezing operators. `	1
The entanglement branching is a new useful operation to manipulate a tensor network. _	1
For example, finding a particular entanglement structure by an entanglement branching operator, we can improve a higher-order tensor renormalization group method to catch a proper renormalization flow in a tensor network space. _	1
This new method yields a new type of tensor network states. @	1
The second example is a many-body decomposition of a tensor by using an entanglement branching operator. @	1
We can use it for a perfect disentangling among tensors. @	1
Applying a many-body decomposition recursively, we conceptually derive projected entangled pair states from quantum states that satisfy the area law of entanglement entropy. @	1
rhIL-7 induced in vivo T cell cycling, bcl-2 up-regulation, and a sustained increase in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. _	1
This T cell expansion caused a significant broadening of circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity independent of the subjects' age as naive T cells, including recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), expanded preferentially, whereas the proportions of regulatory T (T reg) cells and senescent CD8(+) effectors diminished. @	1
The resulting composition of the circulating T cell pool more closely resembled that seen earlier in life. @	1
This profile, distinctive among cytokines under clinical development, suggests that rhIL-7 therapy could enhance and broaden immune responses, particularly in individuals with limited naive T cells and diminished TCR repertoire diversity, as occurs after physiological (age), pathological (human immunodeficiency virus), or iatrogenic (chemotherapy) lymphocyte depletion. @	1
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a homeostatic cytokine for resting T cells with increasing serum and tissue levels during T cell depletion. `	0
In preclinical studies, IL-7 therapy exerts marked stimulating effects on T cell immune reconstitution in mice and primates. `	0
First-in-human clinical studies of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of IL-7 therapy on lymphocytes in vivo. _	0
RESULTS Functional connectivity with the sensorimotor network was reduced in patients compared to controls (p = 0.011) in the left inferior frontal gyrus, i.e. @	1
Broca's area as identified by the word-generation task. @	1
No aberrant functional connectivity values were found in the other regions of interest, nor were any associations found between functional connectivity and language performance. @	1
Neuropsychological testing confirmed language impairment in patients relative to controls (reductions in core language score, p = 0.03; language content index, p = 0.01; receptive language index, p = 0.005). @	1
CONCLUSION Reduced functional connectivity was demonstrated between the sensorimotor network and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) in children with RE, which might link epileptiform activity/seizures originating from the sensorimotor cortex to language impairment, and is in line with the identified neuropsychological profile of anterior language dysfunction. @	1
INTRODUCTION Over the last years, evidence has accumulated that rolandic epilepsy (RE) is associated with serious cognitive comorbidities, including language impairment. `	0
However, the cerebral mechanism through which epileptiform activity in the rolandic (sensorimotor) areas may affect the language system is unknown. `	0
To investigate this, the connectivity between rolandic areas and regions involved in language processing is studied using functional MRI (fMRI). `	0
MATERIALS AND METHODS fMRI data was acquired from 22 children with rolandic epilepsy and 22 age-matched controls (age range: 8-14 years), both at rest and using word-generation and reading tasks. `	0
Activation map analysis revealed no group differences (FWE-corrected, p < 0.05) and was therefore used to define regions of interest for pooled (patients and controls combined) language activation. _	0
Independent component analysis with dual regression was used to identify the sensorimotor resting-state network in all subjects. _	0
The associated functional connectivity maps were compared between groups at the regions of interest for language activation identified from the task data. _	0
In addition, neuropsychological language testing (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th edition) was performed. _	0
RESULTS We found significant cross-lagged paths from prior PA to later depression as well as from prior depression to later PA (beta values = -.039 to -.047). @	1
After subdividing depression into affective and somatic symptoms, the affective symptoms were reciprocally related to PA, whereas the paths between somatic symptoms and PA did not reach statistical significance. @	1
CONCLUSIONS An inverse bidirectional association between PA and general depressive symptoms was observed. @	1
This association was restricted to affective symptoms. @	1
PURPOSE Low levels of physical activity (PA) have been shown to be associated with depression in adults. `	0
The few studies that focused on adolescents yielded mixed and inconsistent results. `	0
Efforts to examine the direction of this relationship have been inconclusive up to now. `	0
The aims of this study were therefore to investigate (1) the direction of the inverse association between PA and depressive symptoms over time, and (2) whether these associations are specific to particular clusters of depressive symptoms in adolescents. _	0
METHODS Depressive symptoms and PA were assessed in a population sample of adolescents (N = 2,230) who were measured at three waves between age 10 and age 17. _	0
Depressive symptoms were measured by the Affective Problems scale of the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist, whereas PA was operationalized as the amount of time spent on physical exercise. _	0
Structural equation modeling was used to examine bidirectional effects of PA and depressive symptoms over time. @	0
The in vitro cytotoxicity of 4-HPR was not affected by ketoconazole (p ≥ 0.06). _	1
Ketoconazole increased intratumoral levels of 4-HPR (p = 0.02), of the active 4-oxo-4-HPR metabolite (p = 0.04), and intratumoral apoptosis (p ≤ 0.0006), compared to 4-HPR/LXS-alone. _	1
Concurrent ketoconazole increased EFS in both CDX models compared to 4-HPR/LXS-alone (p ≤ 0.008). @	1
4-HPR + ketoconazole also increased EFS in PDX models compared to controls (p ≤ 0.03). @	1
Thus, concurrent ketoconazole decreased 4-HPR metabolism with resultant increases of plasma and intratumoral drug levels and antitumor effects in neuroblastoma murine xenografts. @	1
These results support the clinical testing of concurrent ketoconazole and oral fenretinide in neuroblastoma. @	1
We previously reported that concurrent ketoconazole, an oral anti-fungal agent and P450 enzyme inhibitor, increased plasma levels of the cytotoxic retinoid, fenretinide (4-HPR) in mice. `	0
We have now determined the effects of concurrent ketoconazole on 4-HPR cytotoxic dose-response in four neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines in vitro and on 4-HPR activity against two cell line-derived, subcutaneous NB xenografts (CDX) and three patient-derived NB xenografts (PDX). `	0
Cytotoxicity in vitro was assessed by DIMSCAN assay. `	0
Xenografted animals were treated with 4-HPR/LXS (240 mg/kg/day) + ketoconazole (38 mg/kg/day) in divided oral doses in cycles of five continuous days a week. `	0
In one model, intratumoral levels of 4-HPR and metabolites were assessed by HPLC assay, and in two models intratumoral apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay, on Day 5 of the first cycle. _	0
Antitumor activity was assessed by Kaplan-Meier event-free survival (EFS). _	0
Employing a transcription factor, ABF2, which controls the ABA-dependent gene expression via the G-box type ABA-responsive elements, we isolated an arm repeat protein. _	1
The ABF2-interacting protein, designated as ARIA (arm repeat protein interacting with ABF2), has another conserved sequence motif, BTB/POZ (broad complex, tramtrak, and bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger) domain, in the C-terminal region. _	1
The physiological relevance of ABF2-ARIA interaction was supported by their similar expression patterns and similar subcellular localization. @	1
Plants overexpressing ARIA are hypersensitive to ABA and high osmolarity during germination and insensitive to salt during subsequent seedling growth. @	1
By contrast, an ARIA knockout mutant exhibits ABA and glucose insensitivities. @	1
Changes in the expression levels of several ABF2-regulated genes were also observed in ARIA overexpression lines, indicating that ARIA modulates the transcriptional activity of ABF2. @	1
Together, our data indicate that ARIA is a positive regulator of ABA response. @	1
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains more than 90 armadillo (arm) repeat proteins. `	0
However, their functions are largely unknown. `	0
Here, we report that an Arabidopsis arm repeat protein is involved in abscisic acid (ABA) response. `	0
We carried out two-hybrid screens to identify signaling components that modulate ABA-responsive gene expression. _	0
Here, numerical calculations of such textural equilibrium geometries are presented for a space-filling tessellation of grains with a tetrakaidecahedral (truncated octahedral) unit cell. `	1
Two parameters determine the nature of the geometries: the porosity and the dihedral angle. _	1
A variety of distinct melt topologies occur for different combinations of these two parameters, and the boundaries between different topologies has been determined. _	1
For small dihedral angles, wetting of grain boundaries occurs once the porosity has exceeded 11%. @	1
An exhaustive account is given of the main properties of the geometries: their energy, pressure, mean curvature, contiguity, and areas on cross-sections and faces. @	1
Their effective permeabilities have been calculated, and demonstrate a transition between a quadratic variation with porosity at low porosities to a cubic variation at high porosities. @	1
In textural equilibrium, partially molten materials minimise the total surface energy bound up in grain boundaries and grain-melt interfaces. `	0
The mechanisms for these classical morphological responses to axotomy have not been satisfactorily explained.ResultsIn this study we address the role of the cell body cytoskeleton in these structural changes. `	1
We show that the cytoskeleton of uninjured lumbar motor neuron cell bodies maintains nucleolar, nuclear and cell body size and nuclear position. _	1
When isolated, the relatively insoluble cell body cytoskeleton contains Nissl bodies and lipofuscin granules. _	1
After axotomy, protein labeling increases markedly and the cytoskeleton enlarges, increasing nucleolar, nuclear and cell body size, as well as nuclear eccentricity. @	1
Nearly all of the protein mass that accumulates in the cell body after axotomy appears to be added to the cytoskeleton.ConclusionWe conclude that axotomy causes the conjugate enlargement of the nucleolus, nucleus and cell body and increases nuclear eccentricity in spinal motor neurons by adding protein to the cytoskeleton. @	1
The change in nuclear position, we propose, occurs when cytoskeletal elements of the axon cannot enter the shortened axon and "dam up" between the nucleus and axon hillock. @	1
As a consequence, we suggest that Nissl body-free axonal cytoskeleton accumulates between the nucleus and axon, displaces Nissl body-containing cytoskeleton, and produces central chromatolysis in that region of the cell. @	1
BackgroundWhen spinal motor axons are injured, the nucleolus, nucleus and cell body of the injured cell transiently increase in size, the nucleus becomes more eccentrically placed, and the organization of polyribosomes into Nissl bodies is temporarily disrupted. `	0
Using exact dates of birth for inmates in state and federal prisons in 1979, 1986, and 1991, we find robust evidence of effects on violent crimes among whites. `	1
In particular, we find that draft eligibility increases incarceration rates for violent crimes by 14 to 19 percent. _	1
Based on Angrist and Chen's (2008) estimate of the effect of draft eligibility on veteran status, these estimates imply that military service increases the probability of incarceration for a violent crime by 0.27 percentage points. _	1
Results for nonwhites are not robust. @	1
We conduct two falsification tests, one that applies each of the three binding lotteries to unaffected cohorts and another that considers the effects of lotteries that were not used to draft servicemen. @	1
Draft lottery number assignment during the Vietnam era provides a natural experiment to examine the effects of military service on crime. `	0
In this study expression analysis of BTG1 was conducted to clarify the role of BTG1 in the initiation of HCC carcinogenesis and progression. `	1
BTG1 mRNA expression levels were determined for HCC cell lines and 151 surgical specimen pairs using quantitative real‑time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assay. `	1
The mutational and methylation status of HCC cell lines were analyzed via high resolution melting (HRM) analysis and direct sequencing analysis to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of BTG1 expression. `	1
The expression and distribution of the BTG1 protein in liver tissues were evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). _	1
Decreased expression of BTG1 mRNA was confirmed in the majority of HCC cell lines (89%) and clinical HCC tissues (85%) compared with non‑cancerous liver tissues. _	1
Mutations or promoter hypermethylation were not identified in HCC cell lines. _	1
BTG1 mRNA expression levels were not influenced by background liver status. _	1
The pattern of BTG1 protein expression was consistent with that of BTG1 mRNA. @	1
Downregulation of BTG1 mRNA in HCC was significantly associated with shorter disease‑specific and recurrence‑free survival rates. @	1
Multivariate analysis of disease‑specific survival rates identified BTG1 mRNA downregulation as an independent prognostic factor for HCC (hazard ratio 2.12, 95% confidence interval 1.12‑4.04, P=0.022). @	1
Our results indicate that altered BTG1 expression might affect hepatocarcinogenesis and may represent a novel biomarker for HCC carcinogenesis and progression. @	1
Although the B‑cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) plays an important role in apoptosis and negatively regulates cell proliferation, BTG1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been evaluated. `	0
Using mean amplitudes of event-related potentials, we examine the sequential prediction of these appraisal criteria. _	1
Additionally, we apply source localization analysis to estimate the neural sources of the evoked components of interest. _	1
Early ERPs (230-300 ms) show main effects of goal conduciveness and power but no interaction effects suggesting goal obstructiveness assessment of task-relevant feedback information. @	1
Late ERPs (350-600 ms) reveal main effects of all appraisals and interaction effects representing the integration of all appraisal information. @	1
Source localization analysis suggests distinct neural sources for these appraisal criteria. @	1
A major emotion theory, the Component Process Model, predicts that emotion-antecedent appraisal proceeds sequentially (e.g., goal conduciveness>control>power appraisal). `	0
In a gambling task, feedback manipulated information about goal conduciveness (outcome: win, loss), control (perceived high and low control), and power appraisals (choice options to change the outcome). `	0
This is now supported by evidence from animal biochemical, pharmacological, molecular, and behavioral studies and from human post-mortem brain, peripheral tissue, and genetic studies that are reviewed here. @	1
Mood disorders may result in part from impairments in mechanisms controlling the activity of GSK3 or GSK3-regulated functions, and disruptions of these regulating systems at different signaling sites may contribute to the heterogeneity of mood disorders. @	1
This substantial evidence supports the conclusion that bolstering the inhibitory control of GSK3 is an important component of the therapeutic actions of drugs used to treat mood disorders and that GSK3 is a valid target for developing new therapeutic interventions. @	1
Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the complex etiology of mood disorders, represented mainly by major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. `	0
The 1996 discovery that lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) raised the possibility that impaired inhibition of GSK3 is associated with mood disorders. _	0
We establish a correspondence between inverse sumset theorems (which can be viewed as classifications of approximate (abelian) groups) and inverse theorems for the Gowers norms (which can be viewed as classifications of approximate polynomials). `	1
In particular, we show that the inverse sumset theorems of Freiman type are equivalent to the known inverse results for the Gowers U^3 norms, and moreover that the conjectured polynomial strengthening of the former is also equivalent to the polynomial strengthening of the latter. _	1
We establish this equivalence in two model settings, namely that of the finite field vector spaces F_2^n, and of the cyclic groups Z/NZ. @	1
In both cases the argument involves clarifying the structure of certain types of approximate homomorphism. @	1
This paper presents an approach that extends upon modeling simple image-label pairs by modeling the joint distribution of images, hashtags, and users. @	1
We demonstrate the efficacy of such approaches in image tagging and retrieval experiments, and show how the joint model can be used to perform user-conditional retrieval and tagging. @	1
The variety, abundance, and structured nature of hashtags make them an interesting data source for training vision models. `	0
For instance, hashtags have the potential to significantly reduce the problem of manual supervision and annotation when learning vision models for a large number of concepts. `	0
However, a key challenge when learning from hashtags is that they are inherently subjective because they are provided by users as a form of self-expression. _	0
As a consequence, hashtags may have synonyms (different hashtags referring to the same visual content) and may be ambiguous (the same hashtag referring to different visual content). _	0
These challenges limit the effectiveness of approaches that simply treat hashtags as image-label pairs. @	0
Here we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of insect genes expressed in symbiotic and non-symbiotic regions of the midgut dissected from Burkholderia-infected and uninfected R. pedestris. _	1
Expression sequence tag analysis of cDNA libraries and quantitative reverse transcription PCR identified a number of insect genes expressed in symbiosis- or aposymbiosis-associated patterns. _	1
For example, genes up-regulated in symbiotic relative to aposymbiotic individuals, including many cysteine-rich secreted protein genes and many cathepsin protease genes, are likely to play a role in regulating the symbiosis. @	1
Conversely, genes up-regulated in aposymbiotic relative to symbiotic individuals, including a chicken-type lysozyme gene and a defensin-like protein gene, are possibly involved in regulation of non-symbiotic bacterial infections. @	1
Our study presents the first transcriptomic data on gut symbiotic organ of a stinkbug, which provides initial clues to understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the insect-bacterium gut symbiosis and sheds light on several intriguing commonalities between endocellular and extracellular symbiotic associations. @	1
The bean bug Riptortus pedestris possesses a specialized symbiotic organ in a posterior region of the midgut, where numerous crypts harbor extracellular betaproteobacterial symbionts of the genus Burkholderia. `	0
Second instar nymphs orally acquire the symbiont from the environment, and the symbiont infection benefits the host by facilitating growth and by occasionally conferring insecticide resistance. `	0
This study evaluates the combination of cell- and microbead-based digital IIF analysis of ANCA in one reaction environment by the novel multiplexing CytoBead technology for simultaneous screening and confirmatory ANCA testing. `	1
These findings were compared to respective ANCA results determined by automated multiplex CytoBead technology using ethN and antigen-coated microbeads for microbead immunoassays. _	1
There was a good agreement for PR3- and MPO-ANCA and a very good one for P-ANCA and C-ANCA by classical and multiplex analysis (Cohen's kappa [κ] = 0.775, 0.720, 0.876, 0.820, respectively). _	1
The differences between classical testing and CytoBead analysis were not significant for PR3-ANCA, P-ANCA, and C-ANCA (p<0.05, respectively). @	1
The prevalence of confirmed positive ANCA findings by classical testing (IIF and ELISA) compared with multiplex CytoBead analysis (IIF and microbead immunoassay positive) resulted in a very good agreement (κ = 0.831) with no significant difference of both methods (p = 0.735). @	1
Automated endpoint-ANCA titer detection in one dilution demonstrated a very good agreement with classical analysis requiring dilution of samples (κ = 0.985). @	1
Multiplexing by CytoBead technology can be employed for simultaneous screening and quantitative confirmation of ANCA. @	1
This novel technique provides fast and cost-effective ANCA analysis by automated digital IIF for the first time. @	1
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are the serological hallmark of small vessel vasculitis, so called ANCA-associated vasculitis. `	0
The international consensus requires testing by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on human ethanol-fixed neutrophils (ethN) as screening followed by confirmation with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). `	0
Sera of 592 individuals including 118 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, 133 with rheumatoid arthritis, 49 with infectious diseases, 77 with inflammatory bowel syndrome, 20 with autoimmune liver diseases, 70 with primary sclerosing cholangitis and 125 blood donors were tested for cytoplasmic ANCA (C-ANCA) and perinuclear ANCA (P-ANCA) by classical IIF and ANCA to proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) by ELISA. _	0
CD44 and PKCδ were shown to be necessary for induction of the receptor for HA-mediated cell motility (RHAMM), a HA-binding protein. `	1
RHAMM was necessary for HA-promoted cellular invasion and endothelial cell tube formation. _	1
Cytokine arrays showed that HA induced the expression of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI), a downstream target of TGFβ receptor signaling. _	1
The induction of PAI-1 was dependent on CD44 and PKCδ. _	1
HA also induced an interaction between RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I, and induction of PAI-1 was dependent on RHAMM and TGFβ receptor I. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which is decreased by HA via rac1, reduced induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by HA. _	1
ERK, which interacts with RHAMM, was necessary for induction of PAI-1 by HA. @	1
Snail, a downstream target of TGFβ signaling, was also necessary for induction of PAI-1. @	1
The down regulation of PAI-1 prevented HA from enhancing endothelial cell tube formation and from inducing expression of angiogenic factors, such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MMP-2. @	1
HDAC3 also exerted reduced expression of MMP-2. @	1
In this study, we provide a novel mechanism of HA-promoted angiogenesis, which involved RHAMM-TGFβRI signaling necessary for induction of PAI-1. @	1
Hyaluronic acid (HA) has been shown to promote angiogenesis. `	0
However, the mechanism behind this effect remains largely unknown. `	0
Therefore, in this study, the mechanism of HA-induced angiogenesis was examined. `	0
Patients above 10 years carry a 2.5-fold higher risk. _	1
Younger patients cure significantly (<0.001) better with OS rates of 40 and 30% for age groups 2–4 years and 4–10 years, respectively. _	1
Their risks are about twofold higher than that of patients below 2 years with OS rates of 60%. _	1
The better the quality of remission status before HDT/SCT the better are the observed OS rates: 43% in CR1 (1199 patients) and 42% for CR2 (140 patients), and 36% for those in very good partial or partial remission (1413 patients) and 21% for those with sensitive relapse (134 patients). @	1
Patients reported with stable disease in first remission still had an OS rate of 30%. @	1
Multivariate analysis shows significantly better OS in the age group of less than 2 years (<0.0001), as well as a better quality of remission status before HDT/SCT (P<0.0001), with the use of peripheral stem cells (P=0.014), autologous SCT (P=0.031) and busulphan/melphalan HDT (P<0.001). @	1
Busulphan/melphalan HDT/SCT in first remission achieves an OS of 48%, while it is only 35% with other regimens (P<0.001), including melphalan alone, other melphalan-containing regimens, a variety of other drugs given as a single HDT as well as the addition of TBI or sequential HDT/SCT procedures. @	1
Between 1978 and 2006, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registered 4098 high-dose therapy (HDT) procedures followed by stem cell rescue (SCR) (3974 autologous/124 allogeneic) in patients with neuroblastoma. `	0
The 5-year rates for overall (OS) and event-free survival are 37 and 32%, respectively. `	0
The median age at diagnosis is 3.9 years (0.3–62 years) with 76 patients older than 18 years. `	0
Further progress in the field may only be expected from large-scale international randomized trials. @	0
We give a general description of any setup that could be conceived to generate random numbers. _	1
Based on the fact that the initial state of such setup together with its environment cannot be known, we show that the independence of its generated output cannot be guaranteed. @	1
Some consequences of this theoretical limitation are discussed. @	1
This paper questions the generally accepted assumption that one can make a random choice that is independent of the rest of the universe. `	0
To evaluate the frequency of RV, nasal washes were collected year-round from BMT recipients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URI). `	1
We observed decreased rates of influenza and parainfluenza pneumonia and low mortality because of RSV pneumonia. @	1
The role of antiviral interventions such as aerosolized ribavirin and new neuraminidase inhibitors remains to be defined in randomized trials. @	1
Summary:Respiratory viruses (RVs) frequently cause severe respiratory disease in bone marrrow transplant (BMT) recipients. `	0
Direct immunofluorescence assay was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (Flu) A and B, adenovirus and parainfluenza (Paraflu) virus. `	0
Patients with RSV pneumonia or with upper RSV infection, but considered at high risk for developing RSV pneumonia received aerosolized ribavirin. `	0
Oseltamivir was given to patients with influenza. _	0
A total of 179 patients had 392 episodes of URI. _	0
In all, 68 (38%) tested positive: RSV was detected in 18 patients (26.4%), Flu B in 17 (25%), Flu A in 11 (16.2%) and Paraflu in 7 (10.3%). _	0
A total of 14 patients (20.6%) had multiple RV infections or coinfection. _	0
RSV pneumonia developed in 55.5% of the patients with RSV-URI. @	0
One of the 15 patients (6.6%) with RSV pneumonia died. @	0
Influenza pneumonia was diagnosed in three patients (7.3%). @	0
RSV and influenza infections peaked in fall–winter and winter–spring months, respectively. @	0
RESULTS Compared to NDs, RTRs had significantly elevated levels of both CD14(Neg) and CD14(Pos) MDSC subsets (P < 0.001), while CKD patients and ICI-SCC(Pos) had significantly elevated levels of only the CD14(Neg)-MDSC subset. _	1
DC frequencies were significantly decreased in RTRs and CKD patients but were at normal levels in ICI-SCC(Pos). _	1
The MDSC/DC ratio was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in RTRs (median = 5.7), CKD patients (median = 3.2) and ICI-SCC(Pos) (median = 3.5) relative to NDs (median = 0.7). _	1
The use of immunosuppressive drugs in CKD patients and past/current occurrence of SCC in RTRs was associated with significantly increased CD14(Neg)-MDSC frequencies. @	1
MDSC enriched from RTRs, when co-cultured with activated NDs T cells significantly suppressed extracellular IL-10 levels and can, when activated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, inhibit T-cell proliferation. @	1
CONCLUSIONS RTRs, CKD patients and ICI-SCC(Pos) have increased MDSC frequencies and MDSC/DC ratios. @	1
These changes may impact on cancer immunosurveillance. @	1
Therefore, MDSC represent both a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in these patients, with respect to the development of SCC and other malignancies. @	1
BACKGROUND Cancer, particularly cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is a major cause of mortality in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). `	0
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) play a central role in suppressing cancer immunosurveillance but their potential mobilisation in RTRs and levels relative to those of other immunoregulatory dendritic cell (DC) populations have not been analysed. `	0
METHODS The circulating frequencies of MDSC and DC were analysed by multicolour flow cytometry in immunocompetent patients without (n = 13) or with (ICI-SCC(Pos), n = 14) current SCC, normal donors (NDs, n = 34), chronic kidney disease patients (CKD patients, n = 22) and RTRs (n = 31). `	0
Physicochemical, optical, biodistribution, and clearance properties were compared to Cy5.5, a conventional pentamethine indocyanine now used for biomedical imaging. _	1
ZW700-1a, ZW700-1b, and ZW700-1c were synthesized, purified, and analyzed extensively in vitro and in vivo. _	1
All molecules had extinction coefficients ≥199,000 M−1 cm−1, emission ≥660 nm, and stability ≥99 % after 24 h in warm serum. @	1
In mice, rats, and pigs, ≥80 % of the injected dose was completely eliminated from the body via renal clearance within 4 h. Either alone or conjugated to a tumor targeting ligand, ZW700-1a permitted dual-channel, high SBR, and simultaneous imaging with 800-nm NIR fluorophores using the FLARE® imaging system. @	1
Novel 700-nm zwitterionic NIR fluorophores enable dual-NIR image-guided surgery. @	1
The purpose of this study was to develop a family of 700-nm zwitterionic pentamethine indocyanine near-infrared fluorophores that would permit dual-channel image-guided surgery. `	0
Three complementary synthetic schemes were used to produce novel zwitterionic chemical structures. `	0
Here, we review the evidence that DISC1 influences disease risk through effects upon multiple critical pathways in the developing and adult brain. @	1
Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable, and in many individuals likely arise from the combined effects of genes and the environment. `	0
A substantial body of evidence points toward DISC1 being one of the genes that influence risk of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, and functional studies of DISC1 consequently have the potential to reveal much about the pathways that lead to major mental illness. _	0
We sought to evaluate the potential relationship between papillary muscle T1 time and mitral regurgitation in DCM patients. `	1
Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that papillary muscle native T1 time (β = 0.10, 95 % CI: 0.05-0.17, p < 0.05) is significantly correlated with mitral regurgitant fraction. @	1
Elevated papillary muscle T1 time was associated with larger diameter, longer length and decreased papillary muscle shortening (all p values <0.05). @	1
CONCLUSIONS In DCM, papillary muscle native T1 time is significantly elevated and related to mitral regurgitant fraction. @	1
BACKGROUND Functional mitral regurgitation is one of the severe complications of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). `	0
Non-contrast native T1 mapping has emerged as a non-invasive method to evaluate myocardial fibrosis. `	0
METHODS Forty DCM patients (55 ± 13 years) and 20 healthy adult control subjects (54 ± 13 years) were studied. _	0
Native T1 mapping was performed using a slice interleaved T1 mapping sequence (STONE) which enables acquisition of 5 slices in the short-axis plane within a 90 s free-breathing scan. _	0
We measured papillary muscle diameter, length and shortening. _	0
DCM patients were allocated into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of functional mitral regurgitation. @	0
RESULTS Papillary muscle T1 time was significantly elevated in DCM patients with mitral regurgitation (n = 22) in comparison to those without mitral regurgitation (n = 18) (anterior papillary muscle: 1127 ± 36 msec vs 1063 ± 16 msec, p < 0.05; posterior papillary muscle: 1124 ± 30 msec vs 1062 ± 19 msec, p < 0.05), but LV T1 time was similar (1129 ± 38 msec vs 1134 ± 58 msec, p = 0.93). @	0
RESULTS The severity scores supported the use of Chinese wording of 'only a little' (range of median: 12.5-17), 'moderate' (range of median: 50-53), and 'severe' (range of median: 82.5-90) as the descriptors for the intermediate functional levels of the five EQ-5D dimensions and the label wording of 'very severe' (median: 90) to describe the worst level of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. _	1
CONCLUSIONS The Chinese version of the EQ-5D-5L comprises descriptors with similar interpretations as those used its English and Spanish counterparts. @	1
The response scaling exercise is a useful method for cross-cultural adaptation of health-status instruments. @	1
PURPOSE To develop a Chinese version of the new, 5-level EQ-5D descriptive system (EQ-5D-5L) from the existing EQ-5D-3L by identifying Chinese label wording suitable for constructing EQ-5D-5L's 5-point response scales. `	0
METHODS In face-to-face interviews, perceived severity of selected Chinese labels when they were used to describe EQ-5D health problems was measured from 50 native Chinese speakers using a 0 (no problems) to 100 (the worst problems) visual analog scale. `	0
Selection of label wording was based on the severity scores and semantic similarity with label wording used in the existing English and Spanish EQ-5D-5L. _	0
Conclusions: Primary health care physicians in Jahra district should continue to educate parents and adolescents to recognize the gravity of scrotal pain, and the importance of early response as a way of avoiding testicular necrosis. @	1
Objective: To describe the clinical presentation as well as the outcome of surgically explored acute scrotal swellings among children and adolescents recorded at the Al-Jahra Hospital, Kuwait during the period 1985–1995. `	0
Methods: Hospital records of 120 cases were reviewed. `	0
Results: Seventeen percent of the cases were found to be testicular torsions (TT) and 40% torsions of testicular appendages (TAT). `	0
Other etiologies included traumatic swelling (15%), idiopathic edema (13%), epididymo-orchitis (10%), hydroele (4%) and others (2%). _	0
Ages of patients ranged from 6 months to 18 years, averaging 9.3 years (SD = 2.9) for TAT cases and 10.1 years (SD = 6.4) for TT cases. _	0
Swelling and pain were located on the left side for 65% of the torsion cases. _	0
Direct trauma was reported in 22% of the torsion cases. @	0
In 90% of TT cases, orchidopexy was performed with success. @	0
Subsequent testicular atrophy occurred in only 1 patient who had symptoms for more than 48 h prior to surgery. @	0
Orchidectomy was directly performed on necrosed testes in a patient with signs lasting more than 48 h, and another patient with signs lasting 4 days. @	0
Here we explore the contribution of NOD2 to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and found that it was upregulated in kidney biopsies from diabetic patients and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. `	1
Further, NOD2 deficiency ameliorated renal injury in diabetic mice. _	1
In vitro, NOD2 induced proinflammatory response and impaired insulin signaling and insulin-induced glucose uptake in podocytes. _	1
Moreover, podocytes treated with high glucose, advanced glycation end-products, tumor necrosis factor-α, or transforming growth factor-β (common detrimental factors in diabetic nephropathy) significantly increased NOD2 expression. _	1
NOD2 knockout diabetic mice were protected from the hyperglycemia-induced reduction in nephrin expression. @	1
Further, knockdown of NOD2 expression attenuated high glucose-induced nephrin downregulation in vitro, supporting an essential role of NOD2 in mediating hyperglycemia-induced podocyte dysfunction. @	1
Thus, NOD2 is one of the critical components of a signal transduction pathway that links renal injury to inflammation and podocyte insulin resistance in diabetic nephropathy. @	1
An increasing number of clinical and animal model studies indicate that activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. `	0
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2), a member of the NOD-like receptor family, plays an important role in innate immune response. `	0
In the present study, we demonstrate that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) directly phosphorylates and specifically regulates B56γ3, B56γ2 and B56δ, after DNA damage. _	1
We further show that phosphorylation of B56γ3 at Ser510 leads to an increase in B56γ3–PP2A complexes, and direction of PP2A phosphatase activity toward the substrate p53, activating its tumor-suppressive functions. @	1
In addition, we found that under cell growth conditions B56γ3 is kept at low levels through the actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and, importantly, phosphorylation of B56γ3 by ATM leads to upregulation of the protein by blocking MDM2-mediated B56γ3 ubiquitination. @	1
Finally, we show that Ser510 phosphorylation significantly enhances the ability of B56γ3 to inhibit cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. @	1
These results provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of PP2A tumor-suppressive function, and suggest a model for parallel regulation of p53 and B56γ3. @	1
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of heterotrimeric protein phosphatases that has a multitude of functions inside the cell, acting through various substrate targets in cell-signaling pathways. `	0
Recent evidence suggests that a subset of PP2A holoenzymes function as tumor suppressors and one particular family of B subunits, B56, are implicated in this function. `	0
However, the regulatory mechanisms that govern activation of B56–PP2A tumor-suppressive function have not been elucidated. _	0
Here, a role is demonstrated for B-Raf/MEK/ERK signalling in TPA-induced reactivation of KSHV latent infection. _	1
Inhibiting MEK/ERK signalling by using MEK-specific inhibitors decreased expression of the TPA-induced KSHV lytic-cycle gene ORF8. @	1
Transfection of BCBL-1 cells with B-Raf small interfering RNA inhibited TPA-induced KSHV lytic infection significantly. @	1
Additionally, overexpression of MEK1 induced a lytic cycle of KSHV infection in BCBL-1 cells. @	1
The significance of these findings in understanding the biology of KSHV-associated pathogenesis is discussed. @	1
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. `	0
KSHV infection of cells produces both latent and lytic cycles of infection. `	0
In vivo, the virus is found predominantly in the latent state. `	0
In vitro, a lytic infection can be induced in KSHV-infected cells by treating with phorbol ester (TPA). _	0
However, the exact signalling events that lead to the reactivation of KSHV lytic infection are still elusive. _	0
Here we couple growth rates with feeding experiments and food intake functions to estimate daily energy requirements of leatherbacks throughout their development. `	1
We then estimate mortality rates from available data, enabling us to raise food intake (energy requirements) of the individual to the population level. _	1
We place energy requirements in context of available resources (i.e., gelatinous zooplankton abundance). _	1
Estimated consumption rates suggest that a single leatherback will eat upward of 1000 metric tonnes (t) of jellyfish in its lifetime (range 924-1112) with the Pacific population consuming 2.1×10(6) t of jellyfish annually (range 1.0-3.7×10(6)) equivalent to 4.2×10(8) megajoules (MJ) (range 2.0-7.4×10(8)). _	1
Model estimates suggest 2-7 yr-old juveniles comprise the majority of the Pacific leatherback population biomass and account for most of the jellyfish consumption (1.1×10(6) t of jellyfish or 2.2×10(8) MJ per year). @	1
Leatherbacks are large gelatinous zooplanktivores with consumption to biomass ratios of 96 (up to 192 if feeding strictly on low energy density Cnidarians); they, therefore, have a large capacity to impact gelatinous zooplankton landscapes. @	1
The Pacific population of leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) has drastically declined in the last 25 years. `	0
This decline has been linked to incidental capture by fisheries, egg and meat harvesting, and recently, to climate variability and resource limitation. `	0
Understanding the leatherback's needs for gelatinous zooplankton, versus the availability of these resources, can help us better assess population trends and the influence of climate induced resource limitations to reproductive output. @	0
Here, we show that the activating Ly49P receptor recognizes cells infected with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by a process that requires the presence of H2-D(k) and the MCMV m04 protein. `	1
Using H2 chimeras between H2-D(b) and -D(k), we demonstrate that the H2-D(k) peptide-binding platform is required for Ly49P recognition. _	1
We identified m04 as a viral component necessary for recognition using a panel of MCMV-deletion mutant viruses and complementation of m04-deletion mutant (Deltam04) virus infection. _	1
MA/My mice, which express Ly49P and H2-D(k), are resistant to MCMV; however, infection with Deltam04 MCMV abrogates resistance. @	1
Depletion of NK cells in MA/My mice abrogates their resistance to wild-type MCMV infection, but does not significantly affect viral titers in mice infected with Deltam04 virus, implicating NK cells in host protection through m04-dependent recognition. @	1
These findings reveal a novel mechanism of major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted recognition of virally infected cells by an activating NK cell receptor. @	1
Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial in resistance to certain viral infections, but the mechanisms used to recognize infected cells remain largely unknown. `	0
Abstract:In this paper, the experimental validation of a fast and accurate near-field -far-field (NF-FF) transformation with spherical spiral scanning for elongated antennas is provided. `	1
It allows a remarkable reduction of the measurement time due to the use of continuous and synchronized movements of the positioning systems and to the reduced number of needed NF measurements. @	1
In fact, the NF data required by the classical spherical NF-FF transformation are efficiently and accurately recovered from those collected along the spiral, by using an optimal sampling interpolation expansion. @	1
Experimental results, obtained at the Antenna Characterization Lab of the University of Salerno and assessing the effectiveness of such a NF-FF transformation, are shown. @	1
Such a transformation relies on a nonredundant sampling representation of the voltage measured by the probe, obtained by using the unified theory of spiral scans for nonspherical antennas and adopting a cylinder ended in two half-spheres to model long antennas. _	0
We present a novel cluster ranking approach that utilizes Markov Random Fields (MRFs). `	1
MRFs enable the integration of various types of cluster-relevance evidence; e.g., the query-similarity values of the cluster's documents and query-independent measures of the cluster. _	1
We use our method to re-rank an initially retrieved document list by ranking clusters that are created from the documents most highly ranked in the list. _	1
The resultant retrieval effectiveness is substantially better than that of the initial list for several lists that are produced by effective retrieval methods. @	1
Furthermore, our cluster ranking approach significantly outperforms state-of- the-art cluster ranking methods. @	1
We also show that our method can be used to improve the performance of (state-of- the-art) results-diversification methods. @	1
An important challenge in cluster-based document retrieval is ranking document clusters by their relevance to the query. `	0
Here, we report that GA is antibacterial, targeting Gram-negative organisms with higher activity towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the naturally-occurring AMP LL-37 in human plasma. _	1
As judged from flow cytometric assays, bacterial killing by GA occurred within minutes. _	1
Laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa were killed by a process of condensing intracellular contents. @	1
Efficient killing by GA was also demonstrated in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates and approximately 50% of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from chronic airway infection in CF patients. @	1
By contrast, the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells appeared to be protected from GA by an increased formation of nm-scale particulates. @	1
Our data identify GA as an attractive drug repurposing candidate to treat infections with Gram-negative bacteria. @	1
Classic drug development strategies have failed to meet the urgent clinical needs in treating infections with Gram-negative bacteria. `	0
Repurposing drugs can lead to timely availability of new antibiotics, accelerated by existing safety profiles. `	0
Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a widely used and safe formulation for treatment of multiple sclerosis. `	0
It contains a large diversity of essentially isomeric polypeptides with the cationic and amphiphilic character of many antimicrobial peptides (AMP). _	0
We give a direct and simple proof of Touchard's continued fraction, provide an extension of it, and transform it into similar expansions related to Motzkin and Schroeder numbers. `	1
Another proof is then given that uses only induction. _	1
We use this machinery on two examples that appear in recent papers of Josuat-Verges; with an additional parameter, these two can be treated simultaneously. @	1
Communities at the site were dominated by species from the most speciose family of AM fungi, the Glomeraceae, though species from two other lineages, the Acaulosporaceae and Gigasporaceae were also found. _	1
Despite the dominance of species from a single family, AM fungal species most frequently co-existed when they were distantly related and when they differed in the ability to colonize root space on host plants. _	1
The ability of AM fungal species to colonize soil did not influence co-existence. @	1
These results suggest that competition between closely related and functionally similar species for space on plant roots influences community assembly. @	1
Nevertheless, in a substantial minority of cases communities were phylogenetically clustered, indicating that closely related species could also co-occur, as would be expected if i) the environment restricted community membership to single functional type or ii) competition among functionally similar species was weak. @	1
Our results therefore also suggest that competition for niche space between closely related fungi is not the sole influence of mycorrhizal community structure in field situations, but may be of greater relative importance than other ecological mechanisms. @	1
Both competition and environmental filtering are expected to influence the community structure of microbes, but there are few tests of the relative importance of these processes because trait data on these organisms is often difficult to obtain. `	0
Using phylogenetic and functional trait information, we tested whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community composition in an old field was influenced by competitive exclusion and/or environmental filtering. `	0
METHODS We analyzed mother-child HLA concordance and maternal HLA homozygosity in a Kenyan perinatal cohort receiving antenatal zidovudine. `	1
HLA concordance was scored as the number of shared class I alleles, and relative risk estimates were adjusted for maternal HIV-1 load. _	1
RESULTS Among 277 mother-infant pairs, HIV-1 transmission occurred in 58 infants (21%), with in utero transmission in 21 (36%), peripartum transmission in 26 (45%), and transmission via breast-feeding in 11 (19%). _	1
With increased concordance, we observed a significant increase in the risk of transmission overall (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.0-1.7]; P = .04 in utero (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.0-1.7]; P = .04), and via breast-feeding (aHR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.5]; P = .04). @	1
Women with homozygosity had higher plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 32 weeks of gestation (5.1 vs. 4.8 log(10) copies/mL; P = .03) and an increased risk of transmission overall (aHR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.1-2.7]; P = .03) and via breast-feeding (aHR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.9-17.7]; P = .002). @	1
CONCLUSION The risks of overall, in utero, and breast milk HIV-1 transmission increased with HLA concordance and homozygosity. @	1
BACKGROUND Mother-child human leukocyte antigen (HLA) concordance and maternal HLA homozygosity may increase the risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) risk by reducing infant immune responses. `	0
The increased risk may be due to reduced alloimmunity or less diverse protective immune responses. @	0
After extensive efforts to replace the disturbed, missed, or duplicated intervals found in spliced sediment sequences constructed onboard during IODP Exp. _	1
346 to the corresponding undisturbed intervals, nearly perfectly continuous sediment columns and physical property records for the Pleistocene intervals of Sites U1422-U1427 and U1430 collected from the Japan Sea have been established. @	1
Same kind of efforts to correct the shipboard splices were also achieved for Plio-Miocene intervals at Sites U1425 and U1430. @	1
Establishment of sedimentary sequence is essential for the interpretation of the sedimentary records. `	0
Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition (Exp.) `	0
346 drilled high-quality sediment archives with more than three holes each at nine sites that enable us to establish continuous sedimentary sequences through splicing technique. _	0
The continuous records established for these sites will allow a much more detailed understanding of the long-term variability in East Asian paleoclimate and North Pacific oceanography. @	0
Using the mFold program, we designed seven anti-pCD ribozymes and checked the accessibility to target pCD mRNA by RNase H cleavage experiment in a cell-free system. _	1
The sequences of the 4 most effective ribozymes were cloned and stably transfected in a highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, to knock down the expression of pCD. _	1
Downregulation of pCD due to ribozyme expression was observed by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR. _	1
Stably transfected cells with anti-pCD ribozymes exhibited a significant lowering of in vitro invasion (p<0.001) and reduction in lung colonization potential in nude mice when compared to control ribozyme transfected cells. @	1
We also found that downregulation of pCD by ribozyme promotes apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells on serum deprivation. @	1
These results suggest that we have generated a biologically functional ribozyme against pCD with possible therapeutic implications in breast cancer cells. @	1
Procathepsin D (pCD), a zymogen of lysosomal aspartic peptidase cathepsin D, overexpression is correlated with highly invasive malignancies, including breast cancer. `	0
Recently, different studies have shown the role of secreted pCD as mitogen acting both in an autocrine and a paracrine manner. `	0
The aim of the present study is to examine the anti-tumor effects elicited by a decrease in the protein level of pCD by ribozyme and to explore the therapeutic potential of this specific targeting. `	0
In South Asian settings, four studies of organisational interventions in communities that generated funds for transport reduced neonatal deaths, with the largest effect seen in India (odds ratio 0·48 95% CI 0·34-0·68). _	1
Three quasi experimental studies from sub-Saharan Africa reported reductions in stillbirths with maternity waiting home interventions, with one statistically significant result (OR 0.56 95% CI 0.32-0.96). _	1
Effects of interventions on maternal mortality were unclear. _	1
Referral interventions usually improved utilisation of health services but the opposite effect was also documented. _	1
The effects of multiple interventions in the studies could not be disentangled. @	1
Explanatory mechanisms through which the interventions worked could not be ascertained. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Community mobilisation interventions may reduce neonatal mortality but the contribution of referral components cannot be ascertained. @	1
The reduction in stillbirth rates resulting from maternity waiting homes needs further study. @	1
Referral interventions can have unexpected adverse effects. @	1
To inform the implementation of effective referral interventions, improved monitoring and evaluation practices are necessary, along with studies that develop better understanding of how interventions work. @	1
BACKGROUND Pregnancy complications can be unpredictable and many women in developing countries cannot access health facilities where life-saving care is available. `	0
This study assesses the effects of referral interventions that enable pregnant women to reach health facilities during an emergency, after the decision to seek care is made. `	0
METHODS AND FINDINGS Selected bibliographic databases were searched with no date or language restrictions. `	0
Randomised controlled trials and quasi experimental study designs with a comparison group were included. `	0
Outcomes of interest included maternal and neonatal mortality and other intermediate measures such as service utilisation. `	0
Two reviewers independently selected, appraised, and extracted articles using predefined fields. `	0
Forest plots, tables, and qualitative summaries of study quality, size, and direction of effect were used for analysis. _	0
Nineteen studies were included. _	0
In this study, various acoustic parameters were investigated to facilitate the successful delivery of two nanocarriers, a fluorescent semiconducting polymer model drug nanoparticle as well as PLGA-PEG-NP into human colon cancer xenografts in mice. `	1
We first measured the cavitation dose produced by various acoustic parameters (pressure, pulse length, and pulse repetition frequency) and microbubble concentration in a tissue mimicking phantom. _	1
Next, in vivo studies were performed to evaluate the penetration depth of nanocarriers using various acoustic pressures, ranging between 1.7 and 6.9MPa. _	1
Finally, a therapeutic microRNA, miR-122, was loaded into PLGA-PEG-NP and the amount of delivered miR-122 was assessed using quantitative RT-PCR. _	1
Our results show that acoustic pressures had the strongest effect on cavitation. _	1
An increase of the pressure from 0.8 to 6.9MPa resulted in a nearly 50-fold increase in cavitation in phantom experiments. @	1
In vivo, as the pressures increased from 1.7 to 6.9MPa, the amount of nanoparticles deposited in cancer xenografts was increased from 4- to 14-fold, and the median penetration depth of extravasated nanoparticles was increased from 1.3-fold to 3-fold, compared to control conditions without ultrasound, as examined on 3D confocal microscopy. @	1
When delivering miR-122 loaded PLGA-PEG-NP using optimal acoustic settings with minimum tissue damage, miR-122 delivery into tumors with ultrasound and microbubbles was 7.9-fold higher compared to treatment without ultrasound. @	1
This study demonstrates that ultrasound induced microbubble cavitation can be a useful tool for delivery of therapeutic miR loaded nanocarriers into cancer in vivo. @	1
Ultrasound induced microbubble cavitation can cause enhanced permeability across natural barriers of tumors such as vessel walls or cellular membranes, allowing for enhanced therapeutic delivery into the target tissues. `	0
While enhanced delivery of small (<1nm) molecules has been shown at acoustic pressures below 1MPa both in vitro and in vivo, the delivery efficiency of larger (>100nm) therapeutic carriers into cancer remains unclear and may require a higher pressure for sufficient delivery. `	0
Enhanced delivery of larger therapeutic carriers such as FDA approved pegylated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-PEG-NP) has significant clinical value because these nanoparticles have been shown to protect encapsulated drugs from degradation in the blood circulation and allow for slow and prolonged release of encapsulated drugs at the target location. `	0
We employ a dynamic OLS panel estimator to investigate the relative importance of demand and supply influences on the exchange rates of these countries. `	1
Our analysis shows that both supply- and demand-side effects are important for the accession countries, although their overall effect on inflation differentials and competitiveness seems to be small. _	1
An additional focus of the paper is the examination of the role that administrated, or regulated, prices and the productivity of the distribution sector play in the real exchange rate dynamics. _	1
Based on a unique database we show that administrated prices have been a powerful force behind price and real exchange developments for our group of accession countries. @	1
The distribution sector is shown to have an independent effect on the internal price ratio over-and-above that generated by the BS effect. @	1
The main aim of this paper is to examine the exchange rate behavior of a group of four transitional, EU accession countries, with a view to making policy recommendations regarding their accession to full European Monetary Union. `	0
RESULTS IPTi was widely acceptable because it resonated with existing traditional preventive practices and a general concern about infant health and good motherhood. _	1
There was little evidence that IPTi per se had a negative impact on attitudes to EPI or that it had any affect on EPI adherence. @	1
There was also little evidence of IPTi having a negative impact on health seeking for infants with febrile illness or existing preventive practices. @	1
CONCLUSION IPTi is generally acceptable across a wide range of settings in Africa and involving different drugs and regimens, though there is a strong preference for a single dose infant formulation. @	1
IPTi does not appear to have any negative effect on attitudes to EPI, and it is not interpreted as immunization against malaria. @	1
BACKGROUND IPTi delivered through EPI has been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical malaria by 20-59%. `	0
However, new health interventions can only be effective if they are also socially and culturally acceptable. `	0
It is also crucial to ensure that attitudes to IPTi do not negatively influence attitudes to and uptake of immunization, or that people do not misunderstand IPTi as immunization against malaria and neglect other preventive measures or delay treatment seeking. `	0
METHODS These issues were studied in five African countries in the context of clinical trials and implementation studies of IPTi. `	0
Mixed methods were used, including structured questionnaires (1,296), semi-structured interviews (168), in-depth interviews (748) and focus group discussions (95) with mothers, fathers, health workers, community members, opinion leaders, and traditional healers. `	0
Participant observation was also carried out in the clinics. _	0
It also fit neatly within already widely accepted routine vaccination. _	0
Acceptance and adherence were further facilitated by the hierarchical relationship between health staff and mothers and by the fact that clinic attendance had a social function for women beyond acquiring health care. _	0
Type of drug and regimen were important, with newer drugs being seen as more effective, but potentially also more dangerous. _	0
Single dose infant formulations delivered in the clinic seem to be the most likely to be both acceptable and adhered to. @	0
The basic technical idea is to identify the most probable path in the threshold exceedance event, or a heuristic approximation of it, and then use probability estimates based on this path. @	1
The method is particularly useful for long-range dependent traffic and complicated traffic mixes, which are difficult to handle with traditional queueing theory. @	1
Abstract. `	0
This paper is a review of an approach to queueing systems where the cumulative input is modelled by a general Gaussian process with stationary increments. _	0
The examples include priority and Generalized Processor Sharing systems, and a system where service capacity is allocated according to predicted future demand. @	0
In this article we give an overview of relevant mathematical models which have not been investigated theoretically in the context of inverse problems yet. @	1
We consider deterministic models which are based on the physical behavior including relaxation mechanisms affecting the particle magnetization. @	1
The behavior of the models is illustrated with numerical simulations for monodisperse as well as polydisperse tracer. @	1
We further motivate linear and nonlinear problems beyond the solely concentration reconstruction related to applications. @	1
This model survey complements a recent topical review on MPI [30] and builds the basis for upcoming theoretical as well as empirical investigations. @	1
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a relatively new imaging modality. `	0
The nonlinear magnetization behavior of nanoparticles in an applied magnetic field is employed to reconstruct an image of the concentration of nanoparticles. `	0
Finding a sufficiently accurate model for the particle behavior is still an open problem. `	0
For this reason the reconstruction is still computed using a measured forward operator which is obtained in a time-consuming calibration process. _	0
The state of the art model used for the imaging methodology and first model-based reconstructions relies on strong model simplifications which turned out to cause too large modeling errors. _	0
Neglecting particle-particle interactions, the forward operator can be expressed by a Fredholm integral operator of the first kind describing the inverse problem. _	0
In mice subjected to stress, we identified two alternative 5' exons that were down-regulated after stress in the hippocampus, accompanied by reduced acetylation and elevated trimethylation of H3K9 at the corresponding promoter. _	1
These effects were reversed completely by daily administration of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium butyrate for 1 wk after stress. @	1
H3K9 hypoacetylation was associated with a selective, sodium butyrate-reversible promoter accumulation of HDAC4. @	1
Hippocampal suppression of HDAC4 in vivo completely abolished the long-lasting AChE-related and behavioral stress effects. @	1
Our findings demonstrate long-lasting stress-inducible changes in AChE's promoter choices, identify the chromatin changes that support this long-term transcriptional memory, and reveal HDAC4 as a mediator of these effects in the hippocampus. @	1
Stress induces long-lasting changes in neuronal gene expression and cholinergic neurotransmission, but the underlying mechanism(s) are incompletely understood. `	0
Here, we report that chromatin structure and histone modifications are causally involved in this transcriptional memory. `	0
Specifically, the AChE gene encoding the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase is known to undergo long-lasting transcriptional and alternative splicing changes after stress. _	0
Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) mainly affected the processing of the ignored primes, but not the processing of the attended primes: While the latter produced reliable positive semantic priming for both high- and low-WMC participants, the former gave rise to reliable semantic negative priming only for high WMC participants, with low WMC participants showing the opposite positive priming effect. @	1
The present results extend previous findings in demonstrating that (a) single negative priming can reliably generalize to semantic associates of the prime words, and (b) a differential availability of cognitive control resources can reliably modulate the negative priming effect at a semantic level of representation. @	1
The present study investigated whether semantic negative priming from single prime words depends on the availability of cognitive control resources. `	0
Participants with high vs. low working memory capacity (as assessed by their performance in complex span and attentional control tasks) were instructed to either attend to or ignore a briefly presented single prime word that was followed by either a semantically related or unrelated target word on which participants made a lexical decision. _	0
Topical application of manuka oil suppressed the UV-B-induced increase in skin thickness and wrinkle grading in a dose-dependent manner. @	1
Application of 10% manuka oil reduced the average length, depth, and % area of wrinkles significantly, and this was correlated with inhibition of loss of collagen fiber content and epidermal hyperplasia. @	1
Furthermore, we observed that manuka oil could suppress UV-B-induced skin inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines. @	1
Taken together, this study provides evidence that manuka oil indeed possesses antiphotoaging activity, and this is associated with its inhibitory activity against skin inflammation induced by UV irradiation. @	1
Manuka tree is indigenous to New Zealand, and its essential oil has been used as a traditional medicine to treat wounds, fever, and pain. `	0
Although there is a growing interest in the use of manuka oil for antiaging skin care products, little is known about its bioactivity. `	0
Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the primary environmental factor causing skin damage and consequently premature aging. _	0
Therefore, we evaluated manuka oil for its effects against photoaging in UV-B-irradiated hairless mice. _	0
METHODS To investigate the rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects of these drugs, we administered ketamine and LY341495 individually or in combination, 40 min and 24 h before the forced swim test (FST). _	1
RESULTS We found that sub-effective doses of ketamine and LY341495, given jointly, induce significant antidepressant-like effects, at both 40 min and 24 h after administration. _	1
The results obtained using Western blot technique indicate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation may be involved in the mechanism of this action. @	1
The effects of drugs, used at identical ranges of times and doses, on spontaneous locomotor activity in rats were excluded. @	1
Furthermore, the results obtained from the rota-rod test and the ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion test suggest a lack of potentially adverse effects from the combined administration of ketamine and LY341495 at doses previously used in the FST. @	1
CONCLUSION Altogether, these data suggest that the joint administration of ketamine and LY341495 might be a noteworthy alternative to the use of solely ketamine in the therapy of depression. @	1
RATIONALE Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have reported the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. `	0
Because ketamine induces several undesirable and dangerous effects, a variety of strategies have been suggested to avoid such effects. `	0
OBJECTIVES Here, we propose to enhance the sub-effective doses of ketamine by co-administration with the group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist LY341495. `	0
This compound potentially acts as an antidepressant via a mechanism similar to that of ketamine. _	0
There were no strong associations between childhood anthropometric measurements and adult cancer risk. @	1
Odds ratios (ORs) were broadly consistent with a slight increase in risk with increasing childhood stature but no single measure was of particular importance. @	1
The strongest associations were seen for breast cancer (OR per standard deviation increase in foot length: 1.16 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.51), shoulder breadth: 1.16 (0.91, 1.49) and trunk: 1.26 (1.00, 1.60), and prostate cancer (OR for foot length: 1.22 (0.86, 1.75)). @	1
There was little effect of adjustment for confounding factors and very limited evidence that associations differed with measures made prior to the onset of puberty (comparing the associations in children aged <8 vs. 8+ years). @	1
There was no evidence that any of the five indicators of childhood growth was more strongly related to cancer risk than the other measures. @	1
Cancer risk in adulthood may be influenced by aspects of childhood diet. `	0
In the absence of direct dietary data, indirect measures of childhood diet and nutritional status, such as anthropometric measurements, may be useful in investigating diet–cancer associations. `	0
Previous studies suggest that taller adults may have increased cancer risk. `	0
Peak growth for different anthropometric measures occurs at different times and so differential associations with cancer risk may indicate periods of development that are particularly important in determining future risk. _	0
2,642 traced members of the Boyd Orr cohort had measures of foot length, shoulder breadth, height, and leg length made when they were aged 2–14 years; trunk length was derived from the difference between overall height and leg length. _	0
Subjects were followed-up over 59 years to determine all-cause (n = 547) and site-specific (n = 97 for lung, 69 breast, 59 colorectal, 33 prostate, 320 not related to smoking) cancer deaths and registrations. _	0
In this paper we generalize these results to domains in arbitrary dimension. @	1
AbstractMean value interpolation is a simple, fast, linearly precise method of smoothly interpolating a function given on the boundary of a domain. `	0
For planar domains, several properties of the interpolant were established in a recent paper by Dyken and the second author, including: sufficient conditions on the boundary to guarantee interpolation for continuous data; a formula for the normal derivative at the boundary; and the construction of a Hermite interpolant when normal derivative data is also available. _	0
A first large deviations principle is obtained in a space of Young measures. _	1
The associated rate functional vanishes on a wide set, the so-called set of measure-valued solutions to the limiting conservation law. @	1
A second order large deviations principle is therefore investigated, however, this can be only partially proved. @	1
The second order rate functional provides a generalization for non-convex fluxes of the functional introduced by Jensen and Varadhan in a stochastic particles system setting. @	1
Large deviations principles for a family of scalar 1 + 1 dimensional conservative stochastic PDEs (viscous conservation laws) are investigated, in the limit of jointly vanishing noise and viscosity. `	0
METHODS Using an in vitro and a rat model of an orthotopic glioma allograft, this study was to determine whether RG3 enhanced the antiangiogenesis activity of LDM TMZ in the treatment of glioblastoma. _	1
RESULTS Our results showed that combined use of TMZ with RG3 displayed additive inhibition on proliferation of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and rat C6 glioma cells in vitro. _	1
They additively arrested cell cycle, increased apoptosis, and decreased VEGF-A and BCL-2 expression in HUVEC. _	1
Antiangiogenesis effect was also evaluated in the rat model of orthotopic glioma allograft, based upon markers including relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), VEGF levels and microvessel density (MVD)/CD34 staining. @	1
LDM TMZ alone was potent in suppressing angiogenesis and tumor growth, whereas RG3 alone only had modest antiangiogenesis effects. @	1
Combined treatment significantly and additively suppressed angiogenesis, without additive inhibitory effects on allografted tumor growth. @	1
CONCLUSIONS These data provide evidence showing the efficacy of LDM TMZ on glioma treatment. @	1
The combined additive antiangiogenesis effect suggests that RG3 has the potential to further increase the efficacy of LDM TMZ in the treatment of glioblastoma. @	1
BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. `	0
Low-dose,metronomic (LDM) temozolomide (TMZ) displays improved efficacy in the treatment of glioblastoma by targeting angiogenesis, but has a limited effect on recurrence. `	0
The antiangiogenesis drug ginsenoside Rg3 (RG3) is the main active ingredient of ginseng, a popular herbal medicine. `	0
METHODS We identified cases of schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorder aged ≥ 15 years in a large secondary mental healthcare case register linked to national mortality tracing. `	1
We modelled the effect of activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, occupational and recreational activities and relationship factors (Health of the Nation Outcome Scale [HoNOS] subscales) on all-cause mortality over a 4-year observation period (2007-10) using Cox regression. _	1
RESULTS We identified 6,880 SMI cases (242 deaths) in the observation period. _	1
ADL impairment was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.8; p = 0.001, p for trend across ADL categories = 0.001) after controlling for a broad range of covariates (including demographic factors, physical health, mental health symptoms and behaviours, socio-economic status and mental health service contact). _	1
No associations were found for the other three exposures. @	1
Stratification by age indicated that ADLs were most strongly associated with mortality in the youngest (15 to <35 years) and oldest (≥ 55 years) groups. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Functional impairment in people with serious mental illness diagnoses is a marker of increased mortality risk, possibly in younger age groups as a marker of negative symptomatology. @	1
BACKGROUND Serious mental illness can affect many aspects of an individual's ability to function in daily life. `	0
The aim of this investigation was to determine if the environmental and functional status of people with serious mental illness contribute to the high mortality risk observed in this patient group. `	0
These findings led to the fractionation of the ethanol extract using ethyl acetate : methanol (95 : 5), gradually increasing polarity and produced seven fractions (1A to 7A). _	1
Fraction 7A at 150  μ g/mL emerged as being the most promising bioactive fraction with 78.7% inhibition. _	1
FRAP, beta carotene, and DPPH assays supported the findings from the ethanol extract as it exhibited good overall antioxidant activity. @	1
The antioxidant properties have been said to reduce free radicals that are able to oxidize lipoproteins which are the cause of atherosclerosis. @	1
Phytochemical screenings revealed the presence of terpenoid, steroid, flavonoid, and phenolic compounds as the responsible group of compound(s), working individually or synergistically, within the extract to prevent binding of HMG-CoA to HMG-CoA reductase. @	1
If left untreated, hypercholesterolaemia can lead to atherosclerosis, given time. `	0
Plants from the Fabaceae family have shown the ability to significantly suppress atherosclerosis progression. `	0
We selected four extracts from Pithecellobium ellipticum, from the Fabaceae family, to be screened in a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) assay. `	0
The ethanol extract, at a concentration of 500  μ g/mL, exhibited superior inhibition properties over the other extracts by demonstrating 80.9% inhibition, while 0.223  μ g/mL of pravastatin (control) showed 78.1% inhibition towards enzymatic activity. _	0
To address this question, we decided to analyse: 1) which complement pathways are activated by T. cruzi using strains isolated from different hosts, 2) the capacity of these strains to resist the complement-mediated killing at nearly physiological conditions, and 3) whether the complement system could limit or control T. cruzi invasion of eukaryotic cells. _	1
The complement activating molecules C1q, C3, mannan-binding lectin and ficolins bound to all strains analysed; however, C3b and C4b deposition assays revealed that T. cruzi activates mainly the lectin and alternative complement pathways in non-immune human serum. _	1
Strikingly, we detected that metacyclic trypomastigotes of some T. cruzi strains were highly susceptible to complement-mediated killing in non-immune serum, while other strains were resistant. _	1
Furthermore, the rate of parasite invasion in eukaryotic cells was decreased by non-immune serum. @	1
Altogether, these results establish that the complement system recognizes T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes, resulting in killing of susceptible strains. @	1
The complement system, therefore, acts as a physiological barrier which resistant strains have to evade for successful host infection. @	1
The complement system is the main arm of the vertebrate innate immune system against pathogen infection. `	0
For the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, subverting the complement system and invading the host cells is crucial to succeed in infection. `	0
However, little attention has focused on whether the complement system can effectively control T. cruzi infection. `	0
Participants were members of the PRECEPT team and selected experts from national public health institutes, World Health Organization (WHO), and academic institutions. _	1
This article introduces the draft PRECEPT framework and reports on the meeting, its structure, most relevant discussions and major conclusions. @	1
The Project on a Framework for Rating Evidence in Public Health (PRECEPT) is an international collaboration of public health institutes and universities which has been funded by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) since 2012. `	0
Main objective is to define a framework for evaluating and grading evidence in the field of public health, with particular focus on infectious disease prevention and control. `	0
As part of the peer review process, an international expert meeting was held on 13-14 June 2013 in Berlin. _	0
The aim of the meeting was to discuss the draft framework and its application to two examples from infectious disease prevention and control. @	0
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Relationships between maternal age and the rate of embryos that tested as euploid (hereafter referred to as "euploid embryos"), the average number and proportion of euploid embryos per IVF cycle, and PrE. _	1
RESULT(S) We analyzed 22,599 day-3 embryos and 15,112 day-5 embryos. _	1
In women aged 27 to 35 years, the median proportion of euploid embryos in each cycle remained constant at ∼35% in day-3 biopsies and ∼55% in day-5 biopsies, but it decreased rapidly after age 35. _	1
On average, women in their late 20s had four euploid embryos (day 3 or day 5) per cycle, but this number decreased linearly (R(2) ≥ 0.983) after 35 years of age. @	1
The effect of maternal age on PrE was similar, with a rapid exponential decline (R(2) = 0.986). @	1
Across all maternal ages, the euploid proportion and number of embryos per cycle were counterbalanced, so the number of euploid embryos per cycle was the same for day-3 and day-5 biopsies. @	1
This suggests that the loss of embryos from day 3 to day 5 was primarily due to aneuploidy. @	1
CONCLUSION(S) Our results confirm the known inverse relationship between advanced maternal age (>35 years) and embryo euploidy, demonstrating that equal numbers of euploid embryos are available at day 3 and day 5. @	1
OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of maternal age on the average number of euploid embryos retrieved during oocyte harvest as part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, including the probability of retrieving at least one euploid embryo in a cohort (PrE). `	0

High calcium levels are associated with the frequent intrusions of Saharan dust that occur during the summer, and the maximums of chlorine and sodium in the winter may be due to the greater amount of maritime air recorded during this season. @	1
Wet deposition was determined by focusing on nitrogen deposition, registering mean annual values of 155 mgN/m^2/year (from the NO3 (superscript −)-N) and 165 mgN/m^2/year (from the NH4 (superscript +)-N). @	1
This study is an analysis of 344 days with rainfall recorded during five years in a remote regional background EMEP (Cooperative Programme for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe) station in Spain. `	0
The chemical composition of the rainwater associated with air masses (nine categories) and weather types (26 categories) was characterized. `	0
The chemical composition of rainwater was dominated by calcium (Ca(superscript 2+)) and sulphate (SO4 (superscript 2−)-S), with VWM (Volume Weighted Mean) during the period studied (2002–2006), with 55 μeq/L and 34 μeqS/L, respectively. _	0
Calcium, sodium (Na(superscript +)), ammonium (NH4(superscript +)-N) and magnesium (Mg(superscript 2+)) seem to be dominant components in the neutralization of the rainwater. _	0
Additional reductions in the modified k-constrained KP hierarchy are proposed. `	1
As a result we obtain generalizations of Kaup-Broer system, Korteweg-de Vries equation and a modification of Korteweg-de Vries equation that belongs to modified k-constrained KP hierarchy. _	1
We also propose solution generating technique based on binary Darboux transformations for the obtained equations. @	1
The incidence of dysmenorrhea was 9.7% and 13.3% among nonexposed and exposed cycles, respectively. @	1
Among ETS-exposed cycles, there was a positive dose-response relationship between the numbers of cigarettes smoked and the relative risk of dysmenorrhea. @	1
The adjusted odds ratios of dysmenorrhea associated with "low," "middle," and "high" tertiles of ETS exposure versus no exposure were 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-2.6], 2.5 (CI, 0.9-6.7), and 3.1 (CI, 1.2-8.3), respectively. @	1
The findings were consistent with those of analyses limited to the first follow-up menstrual cycle from each woman. @	1
These data suggest a significant dose-response relationship between exposure to ETS and an increased incidence of dysmenorrhea in this cohort of young women. @	1
Dysmenorrhea is a common gynecologic disorder in women of reproductive age. `	0
Previous studies have found an association between current cigarette smoking and prevalence of dysmenorrhea. `	0
This study investigated the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and the occurrence of dysmenorrhea among women without a history of this disorder. `	0
The study population consisted of 165 newly wed, nonsmoking Chinese women (in Shenyang, China), who intended to get pregnant and who had no past history of dysmenorrhea at the time of enrollment. `	0
These women completed a baseline questionnaire interview upon enrollment and were prospectively followed by daily diary. `	0
Dysmenorrhea was defined as a diary recording of abdominal pain or low back pain for at least 2 days during a menstrual period. _	0
A subject's ETS exposure was defined as the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day at home by household members over an entire menstrual cycle before the menstrual period. _	0
A logistic regression model was used to assess the effect of ETS on the risk of dysmenorrhea, with adjustment for age, body mass index, education, season, area of residence, occupation, shift work, perceived stress, passive smoking at work, and occupational exposure to chemical hazards, dust, and noise. _	0
Generalized estimating equations were used to account for autocorrelations as a result of multiple cycles per subject. _	0
This report is based on 625 prospectively followed menstrual cycles with complete baseline and diary data. _	0
ETS exposure was reported in 77% of cycles, within which average daily exposures throughout the cycle ranged from 0.02 to 10. @	0

This work demonstrates that enema delivery of virus is a viable technique for use of mosquito infection. @	1
Enema injection of mosquitoes may be an alternative to intrathoracic inoculation because the enema delivery more closely models natural infection and neither compromises midgut integrity nor involves a wound that can induce immune responses. @	1
Furthermore, unlike intrathoracic delivery, the enema does not bypass midgut barriers to infect tissues artificially in the hemocoel of the mosquito. @	1
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus transmitted by Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in tropical areas of Africa, Asia, and the islands of the Indian Ocean. `	0
In 2007 and 2009, CHIKV was transmitted outside these tropical areas and caused geographically localized infections in people in Italy and France. `	0
To temporally and spatially characterize CHIKV infection of Ae. `	0
albopictus midguts, a comparison of viral distribution in mosquitoes infected per os or by enema was conducted. _	0
Ae. _	0
albopictus infected with CHIKV LR 5' green fluorescent protein (GFP) at a titer 10(6.95) tissue culture infective dose(50) (TCID(50))/mL, were collected and analyzed for virus dissemination by visualizing GFP expression and titration up to 14 days post inoculation (dpi). _	0
Additionally, midguts were dissected from the mosquitoes and imaged by fluorescence microscopy for comparison of midgut infection patterns between orally- and enema-infected mosquitoes. @	0
When virus was delivered via enema, the anterior midgut appeared more readily infected by 3 dpi, with increased GFP presentation observed in this same location of the midgut at 7 and 14 dpi when compared to orally-infected mosquitoes. @	0
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a major source of NADPH in the cell, prevents 20-HETE synthesis and 20-HETE-induced proinflammatory signaling that promotes secretory phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells. `	1
Lipidomic analysis indicated that G6PD inhibition and knockdown decreased 20-HETE levels in pulmonary arteries as well as 20-HETE-induced 1) mitochondrial superoxide production, 2) activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and 3, 3) phosphorylation of ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1 that activate transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α gene (Tnfa), and 4) expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). _	1
Moreover, inhibition of G6PD increased protein kinase G1α activity, which, at least partially, mitigated superoxide production and Elk-1 and TNF-α expression. _	1
Additionally, we report here for the first time that 20-HETE repressed miR-143, which suppresses Elk-1 expression, and miR-133a, which is known to suppress synthetic/secretory phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells. @	1
In summary, our findings indicate that 20-HETE elicited mitochondrial superoxide production and promoted secretory phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating MAPK1-Elk-1, all of which are blocked by inhibition of G6PD. @	1
20-Hydroxyeicosatetraeonic acid (20-HETE) produced by cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases in NADPH-dependent manner is proinflammatory, and it contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic and pulmonary hypertension. `	0
We present a study of some striking statistical properties of cyber-risks that quantify the distribution and time evolution of information risks on the Internet, to understand their mechanisms, and create opportunities to mitigate, control, predict and insure them at a global scale. `	1
First, we report an exceptionnaly stable power-law tail distribution of personal identity losses per event, ${\rm Pr}({\rm ID loss} \geq V) \sim 1/V^b$, with $b =0.7 \pm 0.1$. `	1
This result is robust against a surprising strong non-stationary growth of ID losses culminating in July 2006 followed by a more stationary phase. _	1
Moreover, this distribution is identical for different types and sizes of targeted organizations. _	1
Since $b<1$, the cumulative number of all losses over all events up to time $t$ increases faster-than-linear with time according to $\mathbf{\simeq t^{1/b}}$, suggesting that privacy, characterized by personal identities, is necessarily becoming more and more insecure. _	1
We also show the existence of a size effect, such that the largest possible ID losses per event grow faster-than-linearly as $\sim S^{1.3}$ with the organization size $S$. @	1
The small value $b \simeq 0.7$ of the power law distribution of ID losses is explained by the interplay between Zipf's law and the size effect. @	1
We also infer that compromised entities exhibit basically the same probability to incur a small or large loss. @	1
With the development of the Internet, new kinds of massive epidemics, distributed attacks, virtual conflicts and criminality have emerged. `	0
The sequences of the phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGPase) gene Pgp1 and the 5'-upstream region from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wildtype 2137 and the pgp1-1 mutant N142 that lacks the activity of PGPase (PGP1) were determined. `	1
The comparison revealed the alteration o faGt o Aa tposition 98 relative to the start codon. `	1
This de- stroyed the "GT" splice donor site at the beginning of the first intron of this gene, resulting in an extension of the first exon to 49 translatable codons followed by a stop codon, containing the codons corresponding to whole transit peptide for the chloroplast stroma and the first four N-terminal amino-acid residues of the PGP1 subunit. _	1
The comparison of the upstream nucleotide sequence of Pgp1 with those of 37 other genes including those involved in the CO2-concen- trating mechanism and (or) photorespiration showed the high similarity of Pgp1 upstream to a periplasmic carbonic anhydrase gene Cah1; the motifs RAGGTCAGN8-9CCR and TTGGCAG were found only within the low-CO2 respon- sive genes, including Pgp1 and Cah1. _	1
GAN7CGNTTGGAAN2AG, TTGGAAGGAG, and CAGAGGTCAGN8CCG were found only with Pgp1 and Cah1, and ACGCTTGGCAGT and CATTACCAT were found only with Pgp1 and alanine aminotransferase gene Aat1. @	1
The possibility of functional PGPase isozyme(s) in C. reinhardtii is also discussed. @	1
RESULTS Viewpoints quantity of the Scientific Products Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences stands first and of Babol University of Medical Sciences ranks the end, but from the viewpoints of quality of scientific products of considering the H-Index and the number of cited papers the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences is a head from the other universities under study. @	1
From the viewpoints of subject of the papers, the highest scientific products belonged to the faculty of Pharmacy affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medial Sciences, but the three other universities for the genetics and biochemistry. @	1
CONCLUSION Results showed that the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences as compared to the other understudies universities ranks higher for the number of articles, cited articles, number of hard work authors and H-Index of Scopus database from 2005 through 2010. @	1
CONFLICT OF INTEREST NONE DECLARED. `	0
INTRODUCTION The study of the scientific evidence citation production by famous databases of the world is one of the important indicators to evaluate and rank the universities. `	0
The study at investigating the scientific production of Northern Iran Medical Sciences Universities in Scopus from 2005 through 2010. _	0

Over 85% of H3K27me3 marked promoters were bivalent in human and mouse ES cells. _	1
We found that (i) HC bivalent promoters were enriched for developmental factors and were highly likely to be differentially expressed upon transcription factor perturbation; (ii) murine HC bivalent promoters were occupied by both polycomb repressive component classes (PRC1 and PRC2) and grouped into four distinct clusters with different biological functions; (iii) HC bivalent and active promoters were CpG rich while H3K27me3-only promoters lacked CpG islands. _	1
Binding enrichment of distinct sets of regulators distinguished bivalent from active promoters. @	1
Moreover, a 'TCCCC' sequence motif was specifically enriched in bivalent promoters. @	1
Finally, this analysis will serve as a resource for future studies to further understand transcriptional regulation during embryonic development. @	1
In embryonic stem (ES) cells, developmental regulators have a characteristic bivalent chromatin signature marked by simultaneous presence of both activation (H3K4me3) and repression (H3K27me3) signals and are thought to be in a 'poised' state for subsequent activation or silencing during differentiation. `	0
We collected eleven pairs (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) of ChIP sequencing datasets in human ES cells and eight pairs in murine ES cells, and predicted high-confidence (HC) bivalent promoters. `	0
We find that the actual structures are more complex than what had been previously thought, and that there is a strong shear deformation type structural instability which modifies the properties. `	1
Specifically, we find that normal tensile strain leads to structural instabilities with a large induced shear deformation in (001) BiFeO3 thin films. _	1
These induced shear deformations in (001) BiFeO3 thin films under tension stabilize the (001) BiFeO3 thin films and lead to Cc and Ima2 phases that are more stable than the Pmc21 phase at high tensile strain. _	1
The induced shear deformation shifts the Cc to Ima2 phase transition towards lower tensile strain region (~1% less), prevents monoclinic tilt and oxygen octahedral tilts, and increases the ferroelectric polarization. @	1
The induced shear deformation also strongly affects the electronic structure. @	1
The results are discussed in relation to growth of BiFeO3 thin films on cubic and tetragonal substrates involving high levels of tensile strain. @	1
We explore BiFeO3 under tensile strain using first-principles calculations. `	0
We report that a single Yellow Bullhead ( Ameiurus natalis ) was collected from Silvermere Lake in the Lower Fraser River drainage. `	1
This represents the first record of the Yellow Bullhead in western Canada, and its introduction likely was accidental with a shipment of Largemouth Bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) rather than dispersal from Washington. _	1
Warm, eutrophic, weedy habitat in the Fraser Delta provides ample habitat for Yellow Bullheads and other exotic fishes. _	1
A Blue-eyed Panaque ( Panaque suttonorum ), a loricariid catfish found in 1995 in Shawnigan Lake, Vancouver Island, probably represents a single, illegally released aquarium fish, as does a large Silver Pacu ( Piaractus cf. @	1
P. brachypomus ), which was found in Green Lake on Vancouver Island in 2004. @	1
In Canada, there are no native catfish west of the continental divide and until recently, the list of extant exotic catfishes in British Columbia only included introduced Black Bullhead ( Ameiurus melas ) and Brown Bullhead ( Ameiurus nebulosus ). `	0
The results show that prior to ABMT the proportion of patients with protective immunity against poliomyelitis, tetanus and diphtheria was similar to that of controls. `	1
At study entry 4–10 years after ABMT, the proportion of patients with protective immunity against poliomyelitis and diphtheria was reduced, while all patients maintained protection against tetanus. _	1
A significant decrease in geometric mean antibody concentrations or titres was observed against all three antigens during this period. _	1
Serum levels of antibodies against different pneumococcal serotypes were lower in the patients than in the controls prior to vaccination. _	1
Unlike controls, a minority of patients achieved protective levels of antibodies after a single vaccination. @	1
Despite persistent levels of protective antibodies in many patients post ABMT, secondary booster responses after one vaccination with T cell-dependent vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria and polio) were absent. @	1
In conclusion, this study shows that post ABMT, a full re-vaccination program was necessary to mount responses comparable to those observed after a single vaccination in controls. @	1
The aim of this study was to investigate the late effects of ABMT on the immune system with regard to protective humoral immunity against common antigens and responses to recall antigens (vaccines). `	0
The vaccines were given according to EBMT guidelines from 1995. `	0
The protocol included 35 patients with malignant lymphoma in CR 4–10 years after ABMT, and 35 controls. `	0
The responses to pneumococcal vaccination, which is considered to be a T cell-independent vaccine, were studied. _	0

In our work we investigate Witt equivalence of general function fields over global fields. `	1
It is proven that for any two such fields K and L the Witt equivalence induces a canonical bijection between Abhyankar valuations on K and L having residue fields not finite of characteristic 2. _	1
The main tool used in the proof is a method of constructing valuations due to Arason, Elman and Jacob. @	1
Numerous applications are provided, in particular to Witt equivalence of function fields over number fields: it is proven, among other things, that for two number fields k and l the Witt equivalence between the fields k(x_1,...,x_n) and l(x_1,...,x_n) implies that k and l are themselves Witt equivalent and have equal 2-ranks of their ideal class groups. @	1
Overall, oseltamivir treatment showed a survival benefit, with the greatest benefit shown in H5N1 cases who were treated within two days of symptom onset (51% reduction in case fatality). @	1
CONCLUSION Since prompt treatment with antivirals conferred a strong survival benefit for H5N1 cases, presumptive antiviral treatment should be considered for all possible cases presenting during an outbreak of H5N1 as a potentially life-saving measure. @	1
INTRODUCTION The goal of this study was to evaluate whether any characteristics that are evident at presentation for urgent medical attention could be used to differentiate cases of H5N1 in the absence of viral testing. `	0
METHODOLOGY Information about exposure to poultry, clinical signs and symptoms, treatments, and outcomes was abstracted from existing data in the global avian influenza registry (www.avianfluregistry.org) using standardized data collection tools for documented and possible cases of H5N1 infection who presented for medical attention between 2005-2011 during known H5N1 outbreaks in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey. `	0
RESULTS Demography, exposure to poultry, and presenting symptoms were compared, with only the common symptoms of fever and headache presenting significantly more frequently in confirmed H5N1 cases than in possible cases. _	0
Reported exposure to  infected humans was also more common in confirmed cases. _	0
In contrast, unexplained respiratory illness, sore throat, excess sputum production, and rhinorrhea were more frequent in possible cases. @	0
We have shown that extrathyroidal extension is significantly associated with the presence of “plump pink”cells (p=0.0019), well developed nuclear features of PTC (p=0.018) and tumor associated stromal reaction (fibrosis/dezmoplazia/sclerosis) (p<0.0001). @	1
Other parameters were more prevalent among PTMC foci with extrathyroidal extension, but did not reach statistical significance. @	1
Conclusion: Our results pointed out the importance of a distinct set of morphological microscopical parameters, predictive for extrathyroidal extension in PTMC cases (“plump pink” cells, well developed PTC nuclear features, tumor associated stromal reaction, infiltrative tumor borders and conventional PTC histology). @	1
All these parameters are important to be mentioned in the histopathological reports, as they might be associated with a more aggressive biological behaviour. @	1
Abstract Introduction: In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of some distinctive morphological parameters in predicting the extrathyroidal extension, as marker of aggressiveness, in a series of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) cases. `	0
Material and methods: All consecutive PTMC cases, sized ≥ 5mm, registered at the Department of Pathology, Tîrgu-Mureș Emergency County Hospital from January 2002 to December 2013 were re-evaluated. `	0
The following histological features were noted: the multifocality, the extrathyroidal extension, the histologic variant, the tumor’s border (well circumscribed versus infiltrative), the PTC nuclear features (well developed versus subtle), the tumor associated stromal reaction (fibrosis/desmoplasia/sclerosis versus none of these changes), the presence of “plump pink” cells, psammoma bodies, intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate, cystic change, back-to-back arrangement, intratumoral multinucleated giant cells and lymph node involvement. _	0
Results: Our study included 72 PTMC cases, summing up to a total of 80 PTMC foci. _	0
We pose the following general dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem: {\it Given a nonzero finite Borel measure $\mu$ defined on $S^{n-1}$ and a continuous function $\phi: \mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{o\}\rightarrow (0, \infty)$, can one find a constant $\tau>0$ and a convex body $K$ (ideally, containing $o$ in its interior), such that,} $$\mu=\tau\widetilde{C}_{\phi,\mathcal{V}}(K,\cdot)? _	1
$$ Based on the method of Lagrange multipliers and the established variational formula for the general dual ($L_{\phi})$ Orlicz quermassintegral, a solution to the general dual Orlicz-Minkowski problem is provided. @	1
In some special cases, the uniqueness of solutions is proved and the solution for $\mu$ being a discrete measure is characterized. @	1
For $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ a convex body with the origin $o$ in its interior, and $\phi:\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{o\}\rightarrow(0, \infty)$ a continuous function, define the general dual ($L_{\phi})$ Orlicz quermassintegral of $K$ by $$\mathcal{V}_\phi(K)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus K} \phi(x)\,dx.$$ Under certain conditions on $\phi$, we prove a variational formula for the general dual ($L_{\phi})$ Orlicz quermassintegral, which motivates the definition of $\widetilde{C}_{\phi,\mathcal{V}}(K, \cdot)$, the general dual ($L_{\phi})$ Orlicz curvature measure of $K$. `	0
RESULTS Expression-based grouping produced a significant finding of association between the L(A) allele and adverse effect burden in the entire sample (P = .004 [genotype frequency]; P < .001 [allele frequency]). _	1
To control for bias from population stratification, a white American subsample was analyzed. _	1
A lesser adverse effect burden was associated with L(A)L(A) genotype frequency (P = .03) or L(A) allele frequency (P = .007). @	1
These findings in white patients did not hold when the L allele was undifferentiated. @	1
No association was observed between treatment outcome phenotypes and HTTLPR. @	1
Development of diarrhea and the presence of the low-expression S or L(G) alleles were the strongest risk factors associated with adverse effect burden. @	1
CONCLUSIONS The HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with citalopram adverse effects. @	1
Because the L(A) allele confers increased SLC6A4 transcription, increased serotonin transporter levels in brain and other tissues may lead to fewer adverse effects for antidepressant medications that target the transporter. @	1
CONTEXT The HTTLPR, a functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin), member 4 (SLC6A4), promoter, affects transcription and may be involved in antidepressant drug treatment outcome, although response rates with antidepressants can be lower in patients who experience adverse effects. `	0
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that HTTLPR is associated with treatment outcome to citalopram. `	0
DESIGN A clinical effectiveness trial, Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression, collected DNA samples from outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder who received citalopram in the first treatment step. `	0
The triallelic HTTLPR locus was genotyped in 1775 samples to discriminate between long (L) and short (S) alleles, followed by the A > G substitution. `	0
The low-expression S and L(G) alleles were grouped together compared with the high-expression L(A) allele. `	0

In this paper some of these findings -- those for $k=1$ and $k=2$ -- are extended to polynomials featuring one double root; and a few representative examples are reported of new solvable systems of nonlinear evolution equations. @	1
Recently new solvable systems of nonlinear evolution equations -- including ODEs, PDEs and systems with discrete time -- have been introduced. `	0
These findings are based on certain convenient formulas expressing the $k$-th time-derivative of a root of a time-dependent monic polynomial in terms of the $k$-th time-derivative of the coefficients of the same polynomial and of the roots of the same polynomial as well as their time-derivatives of order less than $k$. _	0
These findings were restricted to the case of generic polynomials without any multiple root. @	0
IL-1α also induced enhancement in the expression of uPA/uPAR in pancreatic cancer cells. _	1
IL-1α enhanced the proliferation, adhesion, and migration in pancreatic cancer cells, and IL-1α-induced alterations of uPA/uPAR expression correlated with the increased the migration of pancreatic cancer cells. _	1
Upregulation of α6 integrin subunit and uPA/uPAR correlated with the activation of Ras and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. _	1
IL-1α-induced activation of Ras and downstream ERK can be inhibited by using inhibitory antibodies against α6 and β1 integrin and uPAR, consistent with the inhibition of proliferation, adhesion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. @	1
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant association between strong expressions of α6 integrin with uPAR in pancreatic cancer specimens. @	1
Furthermore, the strong expression of α6 integrin and uPAR was found to be independent prognosticator in pancreatic cancer patients.ConclusionBased on these findings, we conclude that IL-1α can induce selective upregulation of α6β1-integrin and uPA/uPAR in pancreatic cancer cells and these changes may modulate the aggressive functions of pancreatic cancer. @	1
BackgroundIn human pancreatic cancer progression, the α6β1-integrin is expressed on cancer cell surface during invasion and metastasis formation. `	0
In this study, we investigated whether interleukin (IL)-1α induces the alterations of integrin subunits and urokinase plasminogen activator/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPA/uPAR) expression in pancreatic cancer cells. `	0
We hypothesize that the alterations of integrin subunits and uPA/uPAR expression make an important role in signaling pathways responsible for biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.ResultsIL-1α upregulated the expression of α6 and β1 integrins without any alterations of α5 and αv integrins expression. `	0
Regression models assessed the impact of clinician, patient and visit characteristics on overall visit length, time spent interacting with families, and time spent using the computer while interacting. `	1
RESULTS The mean overall visit length was 11:30 (min:sec) with 9:06 spent in the exam room. _	1
Clinicians used the EMR during 27% of exam room time and at all stages of the visit (interacting, chatting, and building rapport; history taking; formulation of the diagnosis and treatment plan; and discussing prevention) except the physical exam. _	1
Communication with the family accompanied 70% of EMR use. _	1
In regression models, computer documentation outside the exam room was associated with visits that were 11% longer (p=0.001), and female clinicians spent more time using the computer while communicating (p=0.003). _	1
CONCLUSIONS Among pediatric clinicians with EMR experience, conversation accompanies most EMR use. @	1
Our results suggest that efforts to improve EMR usability and clinician EMR training should focus on use in the context of doctor-patient communication. @	1
OBJECTIVES To characterize patterns of electronic medical record (EMR) use at pediatric primary care acute visits. `	0
DESIGN Direct observational study of 529 acute visits with 27 experienced pediatric clinician users. `	0
MEASUREMENTS For each 20 s interval and at each stage of the visit according to the Davis Observation Code, we recorded whether the physician was communicating with the family only, using the computer while communicating, or using the computer without communication. `	0
LIMITATIONS The 12 study practices shared one EMR. @	0
Further study of the impact of documentation inside versus outside the exam room on productivity is warranted. @	0

RESULTS In 162 patients who met inclusion criteria, the frequency of preoperative thrombocytosis was 8.6% (n=14). @	1
Patients with advanced FIGO disease (stages III-IV) and recurrence had significantly higher mean preoperative platelet counts than patients with early FIGO disease (stages I-II) and no recurrence (P=.0080 and P=.0063, respectively). @	1
Patients with thrombocytosis had statistically significant higher rates of advanced FIGO stages III-IV disease, unfavorable grades II-III endometrioid histology and recurrence than patients with preoperative platelet counts. @	1
BACKGROUND The impact of preoperative thrombocytosis as a prognostic factor in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains uncertain and has never been examined in Saudi Arabia. `	0

Using empirical data from Uganda, this research contributes to this gap by (1) exploring how household coping strategy relates to household characteristics and livelihood activity and (2) how these coping strategies vary depending on the hazard. _	1
Coping strategy is found to be hazard specific for households that lack market-orientated activities, whereas those with market access rely on economic activities regardless of hazard. @	1
To maintain and improve the livelihoods and coping strategies of those most vulnerable to climatic variability and change, policies that advocate diversification away from a sole reliance on cu... @	1
This paper investigates what drives household coping strategies in rural Uganda under different climatic hazards. `	0
Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa draw on various coping strategies to reduce the impact of climatic hazards on their livelihoods. `	0
Research to date provides only limited understanding of how the coping strategy portfolio of households changes depending on the climatic stress. _	0
In order to isolate, detect and estimate sensor faults, an augmented system is constructed by considering faults to be auxiliary state vectors. _	1
An unknown input LPV observer is designed to estimate simultaneously system states and faults. _	1
Sufficient conditions to guarantee stability and robustness against the uncertainty provided by the unmeasurable scheduling functions and the influence of disturbances are synthesized via a linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulation by considering H∞ and Lyapunov approaches. @	1
The performances of the proposed method are illustrated through the application to an anaerobic bioreactor model. @	1
Abstract This paper addresses the design of a state estimation and sensor fault detection, isolation and fault estimation observer for descriptor-linear parameter varying (D-LPV) systems. `	0
In contrast to where the scheduling functions depend on some measurable time varying state, the proposed method considers the scheduling function depending on an unmeasurable state vector. `	0

These include (1) direct effects of IL-17 on tumor cells promoting tumor cell survival and invasiveness, (2) regulation of tumor angiogenesis, and (3) interaction with myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to inhibit antitumor immune response and collaborate at the distant metastatic site. @	1
Furthermore, IL-17 might also be a culprit in bone destruction caused by late stage bone metastasis. @	1
Interestingly, in addition to these potential prometastasis functions, there is also evidence for an opposite, antitumor role of IL-17 during cancer therapies. @	1
Metastatic disease accounts for more than 90% of deaths from breast cancer. `	0
Yet the factors that trigger metastasis, often years after primary tumor removal, are not understood well. `	0
Recently the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- (IL-) 17 family has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. _	0
We hypothesize that these contradictory roles may be due to chronic, imbalanced versus acute transient nature of the immune reactions, as well as differences in the cells that interact with IL-17(+) cells under different circumstances. @	0
Analyses demonstrated a significant association between red bone marrow dose and the risk of leukaemia (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) and between colon dose and the risk of solid cancers. @	1
INWORKS assembled some of the strongest evidence to strengthen the scientific basis for the protection of adults from low dose, low-dose rate, exposures to ionising radiation. @	1
INWORKS is a multinational cohort study, gathering 308 297 workers in the nuclear industry in France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, with detailed individual monitoring data for external exposure to ionising radiation. `	0
Over a mean duration of follow-up of 27 y, the number of observed deaths was 66 632, including 17 957 deaths due to solid cancers, 1791 deaths due to haematological cancers and 27 848 deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. _	0
Mean individual cumulative external dose over the period 1945-2005 was 25 mSv. @	0
The percentages of the remaining chlorotoluron 35 days after the herbicide application were similar in Haplic Luvisol (29.97%) and Greyic Phaeozem (30.78%), and slightly higher in Haplic Cambisol (38.58%). _	1
The chlorotoluron distributions in the monitored soils differed considerably 150 days after the herbicide application. _	1
Chlorotoluron was detected in the entire monitored soils profiles (0-50 cm). @	1
The highest concentration was found in all cases in the top 2 cm layer and it decreased gradually with the depth to the depth of approximately 10 cm. @	1
Below this level, the herbicide contents were low and the values oscillated randomly. @	1
The percentages of the remaining chlorotoluron 150 days after the herbicide application were in the increasing order: Greyic Phaeozem < (5.45%) < Haplic Luvisol (11.7%) < Haplic Cambisol (17.48%). @	1
The comparison of the measured and simulated data indicated probably varying chlorotoluron half-life during the experiment. @	1
The results showed that, if the chlorotoluron half-life is estimated based on the remaining chlorotoluron content in the soil profile on the 150 th day @	1
The chlorotoluron transport in the soil profiles was studied under field conditions on three different soil types of the Czech Republic. `	0

Soil samples were taken on days 35 and 150 from the herbicide application to study the remain - ing chlorotoluron distributions in the soil profiles. `	0
The chlorotoluron distributions in the monitored soils were very similar 35 days after the herbicide application. _	0
The major part of chlorotoluron was detected in the top layer of the soil profile (0-8 cm). _	0
The highest concentration was obtained in the top 2 cm layer and it decreased gradually with the depth. _	0
The BPS mathematical model connected with the soil database was used to simulate the chlorotoluron distribution 35 and 150 days after the herbicide application. @	0
Variability in year-class strength is generated during the pelagic egg and larval stage, probably by variations in the hydrodynamic circulation and in the mortality rates of eggs and larvae. _	1
Density-dependent processes seem to occur only during the juvenile stages, particularly in respect of growth. _	1
However, no impact on recruitment variability has been found. _	1
Density-dependent mortality during the phase shortly after settlement dampens the interannual recruitment variability. _	1
There is no evidence of densitydependent effects in the adult phase at present, but these may have been important at lower levels of exploitation. @	1
The importance of the factors determining recruitment vary not only among species, but also over the species’ range. @	1
It is suggested that damping processes can only occur in the demersal stage, implying that variability in year-class strength can only decrease in fish species with a demersal stage. @	1
If true, ultimate variability in recruitment in fish species will be related to the relative duration of the pelagic and demersal stages. @	1

Recruitment in flatfish, with special emphasis on North Atlantic species: Progress made by the Flatfish Symposia. `	0
– ICES Journal of Marine Science, 57: 202–215. `	0
In summarizing the main results on recruitment that emerged from the series of Flatfish Symposia, two aspects were distinguished: mean level and interannual variability. `	0
Recruitment to a stock appears to be related to the quantity of juvenile nursery habitats, suggesting that either larval supply or the carrying capacity of the nurseries is the limiting factor. `	0
However, available information on growth of 0-group flatfish suggests that the carrying capacity of nursery areas is never reached. _	0

Furthermore, in vitro neutralization of IL-10 and studies with IL-10R-deficient mice in vitro and in vivo demonstrated an important role for IL-10 production in the capacity of CD8(+) Treg cells to inhibit CD8(+) T-cell responses. @	1
Our findings identify a previously unrecognized role of CD8(+) Treg cells in the negative regulation of CD8(+) T-cell responses and suggest that modulation of CD8(+) Treg cells may be a therapeutic strategy to control H5N1 viral infection. @	1
Although Treg-cell-mediated suppression during infection or autoimmunity has been described, functions of Treg cells during highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection remain poorly characterized. `	0
Here we found that in Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice, CD8(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells, but not CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells, were remarkably induced during H5N1 infection. `	0
In addition to expressing CD25, the CD8(+) Foxp3(+) Treg cells showed a high level of GITR and produced IL-10. _	0
In an adoptive transfer model, CD8(+) Treg cells suppressed CD8(+) T-cell responses and promoted H5N1 virus infection, resulting in enhanced mortality and increased virus load in the lung. _	0
RESULTS cDNA from mRNA from pre-frontal cortex of a tame and an aggressive fox was sequenced using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform (> 2.5 million reads & 0.9 Gbase of tame fox sequence; >3.3 million reads & 1.2 Gbase of aggressive fox sequence). _	1
Over 80% of the fox reads were assembled into contigs. _	1
Mapping fox reads against the fox transcriptome assembly and the dog genome identified over 30,000 high confidence fox-specific SNPs. _	1
Fox transcripts for approximately 14,000 genes were identified using SwissProt and the dog RefSeq databases. @	1
An at least 2-fold expression difference between the two samples (p < 0.05) was observed for 335 genes, fewer than 3% of the total number of genes identified in the fox transcriptome. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Transcriptome sequencing significantly expanded genomic resources available for the fox, a species without a sequenced genome. @	1
In a very cost efficient manner this yielded a large number of fox-specific SNP markers for genetic studies and provided significant insights into the gene expression profile of the fox pre-frontal cortex; expression differences between the two fox samples; and a catalogue of potentially important gene-specific sequence variants. @	1
This result demonstrates the utility of this approach for developing genomic resources in species with limited genomic information. @	1
BACKGROUND Two strains of the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes), with markedly different behavioral phenotypes, have been developed by long-term selection for behavior. `	0
Foxes from the tame strain exhibit friendly behavior towards humans, paralleling the sociability of canine puppies, whereas foxes from the aggressive strain are defensive and exhibit aggression to humans. `	0
To understand the genetic differences underlying these behavioral phenotypes fox-specific genomic resources are needed. `	0
The average daily course exhibited maxima in the afternoon and minima at night, however differing between seasons. _	1
The general strong seasonal variation with average values for winter, spring, summer, and fall of 0.350, 0.529, 0.986, 0.429 ppbv, respectively, could be well explained by secondary production following photochemical activity. _	1
The large variability of formaldehyde mixing ratios within the seasons was shown to be influenced by different factors in this complex topography such as mixing of air masses from the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere, advection of differently aged air from various source regions, and local meteorological conditions. @	1
An analysis of the impact of large-scale weather types, cyclonality, and flow directions revealed that the cleanest air masses were advected from westerly directions in particular under cyclonic conditions while southerly cyclonic and northerly/northwesterly anticyclonic conditions led to the highest formaldehyde levels. @	1
ABSTRACTContinuous formaldehyde measurements were performed at the high-altitude GAW site Environmental Research Station Schneefernerhaus for more than one year. `	0
This unique dataset was analyzed for daily and seasonal variation and for the influence of large-scale synoptic conditions and air-mass origin on the observed concentrations. `	0
In this study, we demonstrate that the visual system of the Rhesus monkey also misinterprets retinal motion. @	1
We show that monkeys erroneously report the trajectories of pursuit targets or their own pursuit eye movements during an epoch of smooth pursuit across an orthogonally moving background. @	1
Furthermore, when they make saccades to the spatial location of stimuli that flashed early in an epoch of smooth pursuit or fixation, they make large errors that appear to take into account the erroneous smooth eye movement that they report in the first experiment, and not the eye movement that they actually make. @	1
The visual system uses the pattern of motion on the retina to analyze the motion of objects in the world, and the motion of the observer him/herself. `	0
Distinguishing between retinal motion evoked by movement of the retina in space and retinal motion evoked by movement of objects in the environment is computationally difficult, and the human visual system frequently misinterprets the meaning of retinal motion. _	0
We establish existence with sharp rates of decay and distance from the Chapman--Enskog approximation of small-amplitude quasilinear relaxation shocks in the general case that the profile ODE may become degenerate. `	1
Our method of analysis follows the general approach used by M\'etivier and Zumbrun in the semilinear case, based on Chapman--Enskog expansion and the macro--micro decomposition of Liu and Yu. _	1
In the quasilinear case, however, we find it necessary to apply a parameter-dependent Nash-Moser iteration to close the analysis, whereas, in the semilinear case, a simple contraction-mapping argument sufficed. @	1
In this study, we generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae multiple-knockout strain with 24 ATG genes deleted, and we used it to carry out an in vivo reconstitution of the autophagy pathway. @	1
We determined minimum requirements for different aspects of autophagy and studied the initial protein assembly steps at the phagophore assembly site. @	1
In vivo reconstitution enables the study of autophagy within the context of the complex regulatory networks that control this process, an analysis that is not possible with an in vitro system. @	1
Autophagy is a major intracellular degradative pathway that is involved in various human diseases. `	0
The role of autophagy, however, is complex; although the process is generally considered to be cytoprotective, it can also contribute to cellular dysfunction and disease progression. `	0
Much progress has been made in our understanding of autophagy, aided in large part by the identification of the autophagy-related (ATG) genes. _	0
Nonetheless, our understanding of the molecular mechanism remains limited. _	0
Here, we analyze new data that provide measures of the cooling of basement rocks at the base of westernmost Grand Canyon, and use these data as a testbed for exploring the resolving power and limitations of 4He/3He data in general. _	1
We explore a range of thermal histories and find that these data are most consistent with a “young” Grand Canyon. _	1
A problem with the recovered thermal history, however, is that burial temperatures are under predicted based on sedimentological evidence. _	1
A solution to this problem is to increase the resistance of alpha recoil damage to annealing, thus modifying He diffusion kinetics, allowing for higher temperatures throughout the thermal history. _	1
This limitation in quantifying radiation damage (and hence crystal retentivity) introduces non-uniqueness to interpreting time–temperature paths in rocks that resided in the apatite helium partial retention zone for long durations. @	1
We show that for highly zoned with a decrease in effective U of 20 ppm over the outer 80% of the radius of the crystal, the 4He/3He data could be consistent with an “old” canyon model. @	1
To reduce this non-uniqueness, we obtain U and Th zonation information for separate crystals from the same rock sample through LA-ICP-MS analysis. @	1
The observed U and Th distributions are relatively uniform and not strongly zoned, thus supporting a “young” canyon model interpretation of the 4He/3He data. @	1
Furthermore, we show that for the mapped zonation, the difference between predicted 4He/3He data for a uniform crystal and a 3D model of the crystal are minimal, highlighting that zonation is unlikely to lead us to falsely infer an “old” Grand Canyon. @	1
The timing of carving of Grand Canyon has been debated for over 100 years with competing endmember hypotheses advocating for either a 70 Ma (“old”) or <6 Ma (“young”) Grand Canyon. `	0
Several geological constraints appear to support a “young” canyon model, but thermochronometric measures of cooling history and corresponding estimates of landscape evolution have been in debate. `	0
In particular, 4He/3He thermochronometric data record the distribution of radiogenic 4He (from the 238U, 235U and 232Th decay series) within an individual apatite crystal and thus are highly sensitive to the thermal history corresponding to landscape evolution. `	0
However, there are several complicating factors that make interpreting such data challenging in geologic scenarios involving reheating. `	0
Another source of non-uniqueness, is due to unknown U and Th distributions within crystals. @	0
AbstractWe present the implementation and evaluation of an open-domain unit selection speech synthesis engine designed to be flexible enough to encourage further unit selection research and allow rapid voice development by users with minimal speech synthesis knowledge and experience. `	1
We address the issues of automatically processing speech data into a usable voice using automatic segmentation techniques and how the knowledge obtained at labelling time can be exploited at synthesis time. _	1
We describe target cost and join cost implementation for such a system and describe the outcome of building voices with a number of different sized datasets. @	1
We show that, in a competitive evaluation, voices built using this technology compare favourably to other systems. @	1
We introduce a new formalism and a number of new results in the context of geometric computational vision. `	1
We introduce algebraic curves embedded in $P^3$ as the building blocks from which the tensor of a couple of cameras (projections) can be computed. _	1
In the process we address dimensional issues and as a result establish the minimal number of algebraic curves required for the tensor variety to be discrete as a function of their degree and genus. @	1
We then establish new results on the reconstruction of an algebraic curves in $P^3$ from multiple projections on projective planes embedded in $P^3$ . @	1
We address three different presentations of the curve: (i) definition by a set of equations, for which we show that for a generic configuration, two projections of a curve of degree d defines a curve in $P^3$ with two irreducible components, one of degree d and the other of degree $d(d - 1)$, (ii) the dual presentation in the dual space $P^{3*}$, for which we derive a lower bound for the number of projections necessary for linear reconstruction as a function of the degree and the genus, and (iii) the presentation as an hypersurface of $P^5$, defined by the set of lines in $P^3$ meeting the curve, for which we also derive lower bounds for the number of projections necessary for linear reconstruction as a function of the degree (of the curve). @	1
Moreover we show that the latter representation yields a new and efficient algorithm for dealing with mixed configurations of static and moving points in $P^3$. @	1
The classical scope of the research in geometric computer vision is essentially limited to static configurations of points and lines in $P^3$ . `	0
By using some well known material from algebraic geometry, we open new branches to computational vision. _	0
We developed a novel mouse model of human refractory cutaneous ulcers that more faithfully reflects pathology and evaluated the effects of mixed cell sheets comprising peripheral blood mononuclear cells and fibroblasts, which we previously developed for treating refractory cutaneous ulcers. `	1
Model development involved sandwiching the skin between two magnets, one of which was implanted under the skin for 7 consecutive days. `	1
This magnet-implanted ulcer model produced persistently large amounts of exudate and induced the infiltration of the ulcer with inflammatory cells. _	1
The model mice had a thicker epidermis and impaired transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling followed by SMAD2 down-regulation, which causes epidermal hyperplasia in chronic ulcers. _	1
Impaired TGF-β signaling also occurred in the ulcers of critical limb ischemia patients. @	1
Mixed cell implantation in this ulcer model reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the tissues surrounding the mixed cell sheet-treated ulcers compared with controls or mice treated with trafermin (FGF2). @	1
Seven days after commencing therapy, the epidermis was thinner in mice treated with the mixed cell sheets than in controls. @	1
This model may therefore serve as a clinically relevant model of human ulcers, and our mixed cell sheets may effectively relieve chronic inflammation and inhibit refractoriness mechanisms. @	0
We determined the role of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) signalling in oxidant-induced lung emphysema and airway hyperresponsiveness. `	1
IL-17R(-/-) and wild-type C57/BL6 mice were exposed to ozone (3 ppm; 3 hours) for 12 times over 6 weeks. `	1
Bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine was measured, and lungs were retrieved. `	1
Mean linear intercept (Lm) and isometric contractile responses of intrapulmonary airways to acetylcholine were determined. _	1
In wild-type mice but not in IL-17R(-/-), chronic ozone exposure caused airway hyperresponsiveness. _	1
The increase in Lm after chronic ozone exposure of wild-type mice was also observed in IL-17R(-/-) mice. _	1
The increased maximal contractile response to acetylcholine seen in airways of wild-type mice exposed to ozone was abolished in IL-17R(-/-) mice. _	1
p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and dexamethasone-dependent increase in contractile response was reduced in airways from IL-17R(-/-) ozone-exposed mice. @	1
Lung inflammation scores were not altered in IL-17R(-/-) mice exposed to ozone compared to wild-type mice. @	1
The increased release of IL-17 and IL-1β, and the activation of p38 MAPK in the lungs of ozone-exposed mice was reduced in IL-17R(-/-) mice. @	1
IL-17R signalling underlies the increase in airway hyperresponsiveness seen after ozone exposure, mediated by the increased contractility of airway smooth muscle. @	1
The emphysema and lung inflammation induced by ozone is not dependent on IL-17. @	1
IL-17A induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of reactive oxygen species which could lead to neutrophilic inflammation. `	0
In this study, we used 19 selected simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to investigate the influence of domestication on the genetic diversity and structure of S. japonica populations. `	1
Wild kelp populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than cultivated populations based on total NA, HE, HO, NP and AR. _	1
Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC), a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree and STRUCTURE analyses indicated that S. japonica populations could be divided into two groups (a cultivated/introduced group and a wild indigenous group) with significant genetic differentiation (P < 0.0001). _	1
Divergent selection, continuous inbreeding and inter-specific hybridization have caused the divergence of these two genetically separate gene pools. @	1
The significant genetic differentiation between northern and southern cultivated populations appears to be due to inter-specific hybridization and wild germplasm introduction during the domestication process. @	1
In addition, the cultivation of S. japonica has not resulted in any serious genetic disturbance of wild introduced S. japonica populations. @	1
Saccharina japonica is a commercially and ecologically important seaweed and is an excellent system for understanding the effects of domestication on marine crops. `	0
An understanding of the genetic diversity and genetic structure of domesticated S. japonica will be necessary for further genetic improvement and effective use of germplasm. @	0
The present study reports that the cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics, including increased frequency of tumor-initiating and self-renewal capacity, and resistance to the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and ionizing radiation, was diminished in SP cells from late-passage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. @	1
This finding revealed that the SP from long-term passage NSCLC cells was not consistently enriched for stem cell-like cancer cells, and low-passage cell lines and primary cancer cells are therefore recommended in the CSCs field. @	1
The side population (SP) assay is a widely used method for isolating stem cell-like cells from cancer cell lines and primary cells. `	0
The cancer cells used in different laboratories have been passaged for different generations. `	0
Emerging evidence revealed that repeated passaging of cell lines for multiple generations frequently leads to change of characteristics. _	0
Thus, it is worth investigating the effects of repeated passaging on the biological and functional properties of the enriched SP fraction from early- and late-passage cells. _	0
UV/Vis spectrum showed Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for both gold and silver nanoparticles at 540 and 420 nm. _	1
The EDX spectrum of the solution containing gold and silver nanoparticles confirmed the presence of elemental gold and silver signals. _	1
The average diameter of the prepared nanoparticles in solution was about 50–150 nm. _	1
Synthesized particles were either hexagonal or rhomboidal in shape. @	1
This synthesis approach of gold and silver nanoparticles is cost effective and can be widely used in biological systems. @	1
The effect of fruit extract and metal ion concentration was also studied. @	1
We report on rapid one-step green synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles using fruit extract of Averrhoa bilimbi Linn. `	0
UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor the quantitative formation of gold and silver nanoparticles. `	0
The characteristics of the obtained gold and silver nanoparticles were studied using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy (UV/Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). `	0
Archaeological investigations in the Iron Gates reach of the Lower Danube Valley between 1964 and 1984 revealed an important concentration of Stone Age sites, which together provide the most detailed record of Mesolithic and Early Neolithic settlement from any area of southeastern Europe. `	1
Over 425 human burials were excavated from 15 sites. `	1
Of these, less than one-fifth have been directly dated. _	1
This article presents 37 new AMS dates on human bone from five sites in the Iron Gates, together with the corresponding δ 13 C and δ 15 N values. _	1
They include the first dates on human bone from two sites, Icoana and Velesnica. @	1
The results are important for the chronology of Stone Age mortuary practices in the Iron Gates and the timing of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in the region. @	1
Our study revealed no differences in the kinetics of glucose, insulin, C-peptide and non-esterified fatty acids during an OGTT in homozygous participants from a German diabetes risk cohort (n = 1832) carrying either the rs7903146 CC (n = 15) or the TT (n = 15) genotype. _	1
However, beta-cell function was impaired for TT carriers. _	1
Covering more than 4000 metabolite ions the plasma metabolome did not reveal any differences between genotypes. @	1
Our study argues against a relevant impact of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on the systemic level in humans, but confirms the role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in humans as a mechanism impairing insulin secretion. @	1
An important role of the type 2 diabetes risk variant rs7903146 in TCF7L2 in metabolic actions of various tissues, in particular of the liver, has recently been demonstrated by functional animal studies. `	0
Accordingly, the TT diabetes risk allele may lead to currently unknown alterations in human. `	0
Women from North America and Southern Africa were more likely to switch ART compared to men (p < 0.001) with approximately 90% of women reporting a major change after 10 years in North America. _	1
Overall, after 8 years on ART, >50% of HIV- positive men and women from Southern Africa, East Africa, South and Central America remained on their original regimen. @	1
Men were more likely to have a treatment interruption compared with women in low- and middle-income countries from the Asia/Pacific region (p < 0.001) as were men from Southern Africa (p < 0.001). @	1
Greater than 75% of men and women did not report a treatment interruption after 10 years on ART from all regions except North America and Southern Africa. @	1
CONCLUSIONS There are regional variations in the ART regimen commenced at baseline and rates of major change and treatment interruption according to sex. @	1
Some of this is likely to reflect changes in local and international antiretroviral guideline recommendations but other sex-specific factors such as pregnancy may contribute to these differences. @	1
INTRODUCTION In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that all HIV-infected individuals consider ART initiation as soon as possible after diagnosis. `	0
Sex differences in choice of initial ART regimen, indications for switching, time to switching and choice of second-line regimens have not been well described. `	0
The aims of this study were to describe first-line ART and CD4 count at ART initiation by sex, calendar year and region, and to analyse time to change or interruption in first-line ART, according to sex in each region. `	0
METHODS Participating cohorts included: Southern, East and West Africa (IeDEA-Africa), North America (NA-ACCORD), Caribbean, Central/South America (CCASAnet) and Asia-Pacific including Australia (IeDEA Asia-Pacific). `	0
The primary outcomes analysed for each region and according to sex were choice of initial ART, time to switching and time to discontinuation of the first-line regimen. _	0
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The combined cohort data set comprised of 715,252 participants across seven regions from low- to high-income settings. _	0
The median CD4 count at treatment initiation was lower in men compared with women in nearly all regions and time periods. _	0
The main contribution of this article is to show that most of these improvements can be obtained in a unified way from one (rather simple) theorem. @	1
Our result does not only simplify previous results but it also improves them further. @	1
In the literature about algebraic geometry codes one finds a lot of results improving Goppa�s minimum distance bound. `	0
These improvements often use the idea of �shrinking� or �growing� the defining divisors of the codes under certain technical conditions. _	0
We settle a long-standing problem in the theory of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups by constructing many (graded) integral cellular bases of these algebras. `	1
As applications, we explicitly construct the simple modules of Ariki's categorification theorem and prove unitriangularity of decomposition matrices over arbitrary fields, we also prove Martin-Woodcock's conjecture. _	1
Data suggests that transmembrane proteins and the actin-containing cortical cytoskeleton can organize lipids into short-lived nanoscale assemblies that can be assembled into larger domains under certain conditions. _	1
This supports an evolving view in which interactions between lipids, cholesterol, and proteins create and maintain lateral heterogeneity in the cell membrane. @	1
Evidence in support of the classical lipid raft hypothesis has remained elusive. `	0
The results show that: (a) immunization with gonococci possessing a single P.II elicits formation of antibodies directed mainly at the homologous P.II when assessed by either immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting; and (b) immunization with isolated P.II material elicits formation of antibodies that are cross-reactive with all (or nearly all) P.II species in immunoblots; these antibodies recognize mainly the homologous P.II by immunoprecipitation. @	1
These results have been interpreted as showing the following: (a) all gonococcal outer membrane P.II moieties share antigenic determiners, but these common antigens are not generally accessible on the organisms' surfaces for interaction with antibody molecules; and (b) the surface-exposed antigens of different P.II constituents are, in general, different from one another. @	1
Immunoprecipitation or coagglutination with whole gonococci and immunoblotting have been used to assess the comparative antigenicities of 11 different protein II (P.II) moieties from four different strains. `	0
Rabbit antisera used for these studies include both anti-whole gonococcal sera and antisera raised by immunization with "isolated" P.II preparations. _	0
There was a trend toward greater 2-year survival after relapse in the PM group (40% vs. 27%, p = 0.2). @	1
In patients with isolated lung metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma, this is the first study to show that pulmonary resection can be performed safely with low morbidity and mortality. @	1
The improved survival in the PM group may result in part from selection bias but may also represent a benefit of the procedure. @	1
This study was conducted to determine if pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) for isolated pancreatic cancer metastases is safe and effective. `	0
This was a retrospective case–control study of patients undergoing PM at our institution from 2000 to 2009 for isolated lung metastasis after resection for pancreatic cancer. `	0
Clinical and pathologic data were compared with a matched reference group. `	0
Resected neoplasms were immunolabeled for the Dpc4 protein. `	0
Kaplan–Meier analysis compared overall survival and survival after relapse. `	0
Of 31 patients with isolated lung metastasis, 9 underwent 10 pulmonary resections. _	0
At initial pancreas resection, all patients were stage I or II. _	0
Other baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. _	0
Median time from pancreatectomy to PM was 34 months (interquartile range 21–49). _	0
During the study, 29/31(90.6%) patients died. _	0
There were no in-hospital mortalities or complications after PM. @	0
Median cumulative survival was significantly improved in the PM group (51 vs. 23 months, p = 0.04). @	0
RESULTS Of the 16 patients treated for infected osteoradionecrosis, 7 recovered after decortication and long-term antibiosis. _	1
In 7 cases consolidation did not occur until after osseous continuity resection. _	1
In 2 cases the progress of the intraosseous infection could not be stopped with treatment. _	1
A typical first symptom of bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis was an alveolus that would not heal after a tooth extraction. @	1
In 50% of patients with bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis recovery was successful with a combination of surgery and long-term antibiosis. @	1
In the other patients with advanced bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis no definitive cure for the infection of the necrotic bone was possible. @	1
CONCLUSION In terms of treatment, osteoradionecrosis proves complex, yet easier to treat than bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis. @	1
The removal of the infected bone tissue is often necessary, but it does not always lead to recovery. @	1
Therefore it can be concluded that prevention of intraosseous infection by consistent pretherapeutic dental hygiene is especially important. @	1
AIM OF THE STUDY Post-radiogenic osteonecrosis of the mandible is a serious complication in patients with combined treated head/neck tumors. `	0
Osteonecrosis of the mandible can also occur following administration of bisphosphonates. `	0
In the present article we would like to present our experiences over the last five years in treating both bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis and osteoradionecrosis. `	0
MATERIAL AND METHODS Of the patients treated in our hospital for bone necrosis of the mandible between January 2005 and June 2010, 16 were diagnosed with infected osteoradionecrosis and 10 with bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis. `	0
The patients with osteoradionecrosis were administered the classic osteomyelitis treatment. `	0
The same procedure was carried out on 5 of the 10 patients with bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis; the remaining 5 were treated conservatively due to advanced bone infection. _	0
The bone biopsies and specimens of both entities yielded by the surgical interventions were examined histologically after decalcification. _	0
The results show that Trypanosoma cruzi infection in C57Bl/6m mu MT KO mice is intensified in relation to control mice and this exacerbation is related to low levels of inflammatory cytokines produced during the acute infection and the lower numbers of central and effector memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells generated during the acute phase of the infection. `	1
In addition, a marked reduction in the CD8(+) T-cell subpopulation was observed in mu MT KO infected mice. _	1
In agreement to this, the degree of tissue parasitism was increased in mu MT mice and the tissue inflammatory response was much less intense in the acute phase of the infection, consistent with a deficit in the generation of effector T cells. _	1
Flow cytometry analysis of the skeletal muscle inflammatory infiltrate showed a predominance of CD8(+) CD45Rb low in B-cell-sufficient C57Bl/6 mice, whereas the preponderant cell type in mu MT KO skeletal muscle inflammatory infiltrate was CD4(+) T cells. @	1
In addition, CD8(+) T cells found in skeletal muscle from mu MT KO infected mice were less activated than in control B-cell sufficient infected mice. @	1
These results suggest that B cells may participate in the generation of effector/memory T cells. @	1
In addition and more importantly, B cells were crucial in the maintenance of central and effector memory CD8(+) T cell, as well as the determination of the T cell cytokine functional pattern, and they may therefore account for critical aspects of the resistance to intracellular pathogens, such as T. cruzi. @	1
In this study, we have evaluated the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the formation of central and effector memory T cells in mice lacking mature B cells (mu MT KO). `	0
Future middleware platforms will need to be more configurable in order to meet the demands of a wide variety of application domains. `	1
This paper discusses the role of software architecture in maintaining the overall integrity of the system in such an environment. @	1
More specifically, the paper discusses extensions to the Aster framework to support the re-configuration of a reflective (component-based) middleware platform in a constrained manner. @	1
The approach is based on i) the formal specification of a range of possible component configurations, ii) the systematic selection of configurations based on a given set of non-functional properties, and iii) the orderly re-configuration between configurations, again based on formally specified rules. @	1
Furthermore, we believe that such platforms will also need to be reconfigurable, for example to enable systems to adapt to changes in the underlying systems infrastructure. `	0
A number of technologies are emerging to support this level of configurability and re-configurability, most notably middleware platforms based on the concepts of open implementation and reflection. _	0
One problem with this general approach is that widespread changes can often be made to the middleware platform, potentially jeopardizing the integrity of the overall system. _	0
Conclusion: Patients in the SLHCC group had an overall survival rate intermediate to those of the BCLC-A and BCLC-B groups. @	1
It is suggested that the SLHCC group could be classified as occupying a different stage from the BCLC stages A and B. @	1
The ALBI grade could help to stratify SLHCC into a different prognostic group. @	1
However, the results need to be validated externally in other regions of the world. @	1
Background/Aims: Whether single large hepatocellular carcinoma (SLHCC) is classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or B is still controversial. `	0
We aimed to compare the clinical manifestations, treatment modalities, and prognoses among patients with SLHCC and those in BCLC stage A and B. `	0
Methods: We enrolled 2,285 treatment-naive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with BCLC stage A or B from October 2007 to December 2015. `	0
Factors in terms of prognoses were analyzed by multivariate analysis. `	0
Results: We enrolled 1,210, 466, and 609 patients in a BCLC-A, SLHCC, and BCLC-B group, respectively. `	0
After a median follow-up duration of 21.2 months, 898 patients had died. _	0
The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 57.0, 42.6, and 27.3% for patients in the BCLC-A, SLHCC, and BCLC-B groups, respectively, which were significantly different (p < 0.001). _	0
Multivariate analysis indicated that the following independent risk factors were associated with poor prognosis: age > 65 years, alkaline phosphatase > 100 U/L, creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL, alpha-fetoprotein > 20 mg/mL, noncurative treatment, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, and HCC staging. _	0
Subgroup analysis also confirmed that patients in the SLHCC group had a survival rate intermediate to those in the BCLC-A and BCLC-B groups. _	0
However, for patients in the SLHCC group and with ALBI grade 1, outcomes were close to those in the BCLC-A group, especially in the setting of curative treatment. _	0
For those with ALBI grades 2 or 3, the prognoses were similar to those of the SLHCC and BCLC-B groups. @	0
Search engine advertisements can direct users to evidence-based content at a highly teachable moment--when they are seeking relevant information. @	1
To direct online users searching for gynecologic cancer information to accurate content, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 'Inside Knowledge: Get the Facts About Gynecologic Cancer' campaign sponsored search engine advertisements in English and Spanish. `	0
From June 2012 to August 2013, advertisements appeared when US Google users entered search terms related to gynecologic cancer. _	0
Users who clicked on the advertisements were directed to relevant content on the CDC website. @	0
Compared with the 3 months before the initiative (March-May 2012), visits to the CDC web pages linked to the advertisements were 26 times higher after the initiative began (June-August 2012) (p<0.01), and 65 times higher when the search engine advertisements were supplemented with promotion on television and additional websites (September 2012-August 2013) (p<0.01). @	0
Restriction of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) supply to plastids causes lethality of female and male gametophytes in Arabidopsis thaliana defective in both a phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT) of the inner envelope membrane and the plastid-localized enolase (ENO1) involved in glycolytic PEP provision. `	1
Homozygous double mutants of cue1 (defective in PPT1) and eno1 could not be obtained, and homozygous cue1 heterozygous eno1 mutants [cue1/eno1(+/-)] exhibited retarded vegetative growth, disturbed flower development, and up to 80% seed abortion. `	1
The phenotypes of diminished oil in seeds, reduced flavonoids and aromatic amino acids in flowers, compromised lignin biosynthesis in stems, and aberrant exine formation in pollen indicate that cue1/eno1(+/-) disrupts multiple pathways. _	1
While diminished fatty acid biosynthesis from PEP via plastidial pyruvate kinase appears to affect seed abortion, a restriction in the shikimate pathway affects formation of sporopollonin in the tapetum and lignin in the stem. _	1
Vegetative parts of cue1/eno1(+/-) contained increased free amino acids and jasmonic acid but had normal wax biosynthesis. @	1
ENO1 overexpression in cue1 rescued the leaf and root phenotypes, restored photosynthetic capacity, and improved seed yield and oil contents. @	1
In chloroplasts, ENO1 might be the only enzyme missing for a complete plastidic glycolysis. @	0
In this study, we proposed a gradient-based modification to the cuckoo search algorithm, which is a nature-inspired swarm-based stochastic global optimization method. _	1
We introduced the gradient-based cuckoo search (GBCS) and evaluated its performance vis-a-vis the original algorithm in solving twenty-four benchmark functions. _	1
The use of GBCS improved reliability and effectiveness of the algorithm in all but four of the tested benchmark problems. @	1
GBCS proved to be a strong candidate for solving difficult optimization problems, for which the gradient of the objective function is readily available. @	1
One of the major advantages of stochastic global optimization methods is the lack of the need of the gradient of the objective function. `	0
However, in some cases, this gradient is readily available and can be used to improve the numerical performance of stochastic optimization methods specially the quality and precision of global optimal solution. `	0
To make a fair comparison between the SS and LCC WPT systems, the direct current (DC) link voltage was adjusted to set equal load power for the two systems whilst using identical transmit and receive coils, coil-to-coil distance and load resistance. _	1
The system performance in terms of the system efficiency, the voltage stresses on the components, and the losses in the power devices were analysed for a practical system, comparing the LCC-WPT system and the SS-WPT system with respect to the load resistance. @	1
The effect of coil misalignment on the transferred power and efficiency for the two systems was compared. @	1
The theoretical proof and the conditions for meeting the objective are derived and practically verified in a two-coil WPT practical prototype, showing good agreement between analysis and experiments. @	1
A new design approach is presented in this paper to show that under certain conditions, in a two-coil wireless power transfer system, the double-sided inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) compensated wireless power transfer (LCC-WPT) system can be more energy efficient than the series-series (SS) compensated wireless power transfer (SS-WPT) system for the same load power, with special attention being paid to the effect that the parasitic coil and capacitor resistances have on the system efficiency. `	0
There were linear trends in the development of CVD (adjusted for age and smoking) for all the men from the lowest to the highest quintile of WHTR (P=0.034), but not for waist circumference (P=0.095), or BMI (P>0.2). `	1
Excluding the hypertensive men increased the significance of the trend for WHTR (P=0.005) and waist circumference (P=0.027). _	1
The significant interactions with hypertension for WHTR (P<0.001), waist circumference (P=0.006) and BMI (P=0.044) showed that there was an increasing incidence of CVD with increasing adiposity in non-hypertensive men but, in men with treated hypertension, although the overall incidence of CVD was higher, the relationship with adiposity was inverse.In the women, there were no significant linear trends for waist circumference, WHTR or BMI. _	1
Quintile estimates were more consistent with J-shaped curves with the lowest risk in the second quintile. _	1
Excluding the hypertensive women, increased the significance of these trends. _	1
In normotensive women, there was a significant quadratic trend (P=0.039) for the association between the incidence of CVD and the quintiles of waist circumference, but no associations for WHTR or BMI. _	1
For waist circumference there was weak evidence of an interaction with hypertension (P=0.053).CONCLUSIONS: For the men, indices involving waist circunference, particularly WHTR, had stronger linear associations with the log odds of CVD development than BMI. @	1
The interactions with hypertension were significant for WHTR, waist circunferenceand also BMI. @	1
In women, none of the indices was linearly associated with the log odds of CVD development, but there was a significant J-shaped curve for waist circumference and evidence of an interaction with hypertension. @	1
These results suggest that studies in which hypertensives are included, but in which possible hypertension interactions are overlooked, important hypertensive-specific associations between anthropometric indices and CVD development may be masked. @	1
Men on anti-hypertensive medication with the lowest central adiposity, experienced higher short-term CVD risk than those with greater central adiposity. @	1
OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive ability of simple anthropometric indices for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over seven years in British adults, and the influence of hypertension on these associations.DESIGN: Longitudinal study of the development of CVD (morbidity or mortality) over a seven year period in a random stratified sample of British adults who were respondents in the 1984–1985 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS1) and who were seen again in 1991–1992 (HALS2) or who had died by then.METHODS: Face-to-face interviews at HALS1 and HALS2 recorded socio-demographic, health and lifestyle details followed by measurements of height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure (BP). `	0
The quintiles of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist : height ratio (WHTR) and height were calculated for those aged between 35 and 75 y, at HALS1. `	0
Dates and causes of death were recorded. `	0
Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of developing CVD in 1284 men and 1570 women, aged 35–75 y who were free of known CVD, cancer and diabetes at HALS1.RESULTS: By HALS2, 316 respondents in the qualifying population had developed CVD, 114 of whom were dead. `	0
We have empirically validated this model in practice by assessing the relevance, implementation and plans of the elements in three integrated care service settings in The Netherlands: stroke, acute myocardial infarct (AMI), and dementia. `	1
RESULTS The results indicate that the integrated care practice organizations in all three care settings rated the nine clusters and 89 elements of the DMIC as highly relevant. _	1
The average number of elements implemented was 50 ± 18, 42 ± 13, and 45 ± 22 for stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and dementia care services, respectively. _	1
Although the dementia networks were significantly younger, their numbers of implemented elements were comparable to those of the other services. @	1
The analyses of the implementation timelines showed that the older integrated care services had fewer plans for further implementation than the younger ones. @	1
Integrated care coordinators stated that the DMIC helped them to assess their integrated care development in practice and supported them in obtaining ideas for expanding their integrated care activities. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Although the patient composites and the characteristics of the 84 participating integrated care services differed considerably, the results confirm that the clusters and the vast majority of DMIC elements are relevant to all three groups. @	1
Therefore, the DMIC can serve as a general quality management tool for integrated care. @	1
BACKGROUND Integrated care is considered as a strategy to improve the delivery, efficiency, client outcomes and satisfaction rates of health care. `	0
To integrate the care from multiple providers into a coherent client-focused service, a large number of activities and agreements have to be implemented like streamlining information flows and patient transfers. `	0
The Development Model for Integrated care (DMIC) describes nine clusters containing in total 89 elements that contribute to the integration of care. `	0
METHODS Based on the DMIC, a survey was developed for integrated care coordinators. `	0
We invited all Dutch stroke and AMI-services, as well as the dementia care networks to participate, of which 84 did (response rate 83%). _	0
Data were collected on relevance, presence, and year of implementation of the 89 elements. _	0
The data analysis was done by means of descriptive statistics, Chi Square, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. _	0
Applying the model in practice can help in steering further implementations as well as the development of new integrated care practices. @	0
Application of the eSEA reveals that the Ybbs catchment, compared to the Wulka catchment leads to a greater extent of N dispersion, primarily as a result of increased losses of N compounds to the atmosphere and in leachates to the groundwater. _	1
The NUE in the Wulka catchment, at 63 %, is substantially higher than that in the Ybbs catchment, at 43 %, and confirms a more efficient N use in Wulka. @	1
Furthermore, it is shown that the adoption of a healthy, balanced diet, as defined by the German Nutrition Society, changes the N budget of Austria in a way that significantly reduces the dispersion of N. Decreased N losses to the atmosphere and to the groundwater are primarily responsible for this result. @	1
The national NUE of Austria responds only moderately to the adoption of such a diet increasing from 48 to 53 % and leads to statistically insignificant results if the uncertainty of the input data is taken into account. @	1
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of eSEA for the evaluation of N budgets in agricultural regions and suggests that statistical entropy can serve as a reliable agri-environmental indicator to support decisions regarding nutrient management. @	1
Extended statistical entropy analysis (eSEA) is used to evaluate the nitrogen (N) budgets of two Austrian catchments, the Wulka and the Ybbs, and of entire Austria. `	0
The eSEA quantifies the extent of N dispersion in the environment. `	0
The results from the eSEA are compared to the corresponding N use efficiencies (NUEs). _	0
Here, we describe a surgical technique for implantation of a commercially available telemetry transmitter used for continuous measurements of core body temperature, locomotor activity and biopotential (i.e. @	1
onelead ECG), from which heart rate, heart rate variability, and PQ and QT intervals can be established in freeroaming, untethered mice. @	1
We also present pre-operative procedures and protocols for post-operative intensive care and pain treatment that improve recovery, well-being and survival rates in implanted mice. @	1
The laboratory mouse is the animal species of choice for most biomedical research, in both the academic sphere and the pharmaceutical industry. `	0
Mice are a manageable size and relatively easy to house. `	0
These factors, together with the availability of a wealth of spontaneous and experimentally induced mutants, make laboratory mice ideally suited to a wide variety of research areas. `	0
In cardiovascular, pharmacological and toxicological research, accurate measurement of parameters relating to the circulatory system of laboratory animals is often required. `	0
Determination of heart rate, heart rate variability, and duration of PQ and QT intervals are based on electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. `	0
However, obtaining reliable ECG curves as well as physiological data such as core body temperature in mice can be difficult using conventional measurement techniques, which require connecting sensors and lead wires to a restrained, tethered, or even anaesthetized animal. _	0
Data obtained in this fashion must be interpreted with caution, as it is well known that restraining and anesthesia can have a major artifactual influence on physiological parameters. _	0
Radiotelemetry enables data to be collected from conscious and untethered animals. _	0
Measurements can be conducted even in freely moving animals, and without requiring the investigator to be in the proximity of the animal. _	0
Thus, known sources of artifacts are avoided, and accurate and reliable measurements are assured. _	0
This methodology also reduces interanimal variability, thus reducing the number of animals used, rendering this technology the most humane method of monitoring physiological parameters in laboratory animals. @	0
Constant advancements in data acquisition technology and implant miniaturization mean that it is now possible to record physiological parameters and locomotor activity continuously and in realtime over longer periods such as hours, days or even weeks. @	0
Here, we report detailed mineral and matrix analyses of the tibia of these animals based on Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy and imaging. _	1
At 10 weeks, there was significant hypercalcification of the calcified cartilage and cortices in the KO. _	1
Carbonate content was elevated in the KO calcified cartilage as well as cortical and cancellous bone areas. @	1
These data suggest that cathepsin K does not affect mineral deposition but has a significant effect on mineralized tissue remodeling. @	1
Since growth plate abnormalities were extensive despite reported low levels of cathepsin K expression in the calcified cartilage, we used a differentiating chick limb-bud mesenchymal cell system that mimics endochondral ossification but does not contain osteoclasts, to show that cathepsin K inhibition during initial stages of mineral deposition retards the mineralization process while general inhibition of cathepsins can increase mineralization. @	1
These data suggest that the hypercalcification of the cathepsin K-deficient growth plate is due to persistence of calcified cartilage and point to a role of cathepsin K in bone tissue development as well as skeletal remodeling. @	1
Cathepsin K deficiency in humans causes pycnodysostosis, which is characterized by dwarfism and osteosclerosis. `	0
Earlier studies of 10-week-old male cathepsin K-deficient (knockout, KO) mice showed their bones were mechanically more brittle, while histomorphometry showed that both osteoclasts and osteoblasts had impaired activity relative to the wild type (WT). `	0
This study demonstrates that bite force predictions based on two-dimensional (2-D) lever models can be improved by including three-dimensional (3-D) geometry and realistic physiological cross-sectional areas derived from dissections. _	1
We found that lever models that include the three dimensional structure of the skull and mandible and physiological cross-sectional areas calculated from dissected muscles provide the best predictions of bite force. @	1
Models that accurately represent the biting mechanics strengthen our understanding of which variables are functionally relevant and how they are relevant to feeding performance. @	1
Bite force is a measure of whole-organism performance that is often used to investigate the relationships between performance, morphology and fitness. `	0
When in vivo measurements of bite force are unavailable, researchers often turn to lever models to predict bite forces. `	0
Widely used, the 2-D method does a reasonable job of predicting bite force. _	0
However, it does so by over predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the masseter and pterygoid muscles and under predicting physiological cross-sectional areas for the temporalis muscle. @	0
We sought to confirm and explore the role of SIRT2 in necroptosis and tested four different sources of the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2, three independent short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Sirt2, and cells from two independently generated Sirt2−/− mouse strains; however, we were unable to show that inhibiting or depleting SIRT2 protected cells from necroptosis. _	1
Furthermore, Sirt2−/− mice succumbed to tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) more rapidly than wild-type mice, whereas Ripk3−/− mice were resistant. @	1
Our results therefore question the importance of SIRT2 in the necroptosis cell death pathway. @	1
Arising from N. Narayan et al. `	0
492, 199–204 (2012)10.1038/nature11700Sirtuins can promote deacetylation of a wide range of substrates in diverse cellular compartments to regulate many cellular processes; recently, Narayan et al. `	0
reported that SIRT2 was required for necroptosis on the basis of their findings that SIRT2 inhibition, knockdown or knockout prevented necroptosis. _	0
A comparative histomorphometric analysis was conducted and a statistical analysis was performed. _	1
RESULTS All implants in both groups were functional after a 12-month loading period. _	1
No bone loss was observed radiographically or clinically in both groups. @	1
Histologic analysis revealed that both composite grafts had a high biocompatibility. @	1
In the bovine HA-containing group, minimal xenogenic graft absorption was noted. @	1
In contrast, BG group samples presented a high absorption rate with some remaining particles imbedded in new normal bone. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Sinus augmentation using a combination of autogenous bone plus either bovine HA or BG is a predictable technique. @	1
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Sinus augmentation is a procedure used for augmenting insufficient bone height that is often observed in the maxillary posterior areas. `	0
Many different techniques as well as bone graft regimens have been suggested for performing this procedure. `	0
It was the goal of this study to compare, clinically and histologically, two different composite grafting regimens used for sinus augmentation. `	0
MATERIAL AND METHODS Five patients, needing a bilateral sinus augmentation to allow implant placement, were recruited for this study. `	0
Right sinuses were grafted with cortical bone (collected from overlying the sinus membrane) and bovine hydroxyapatite (HA), while the left side sinuses were grafted with overlying autologous bone plus a bioglass (BG) material. `	0
Bone core biopsies were taken at 6 months after sinus graft or at the time of implant insertion. _	0
A waiting period of 6 additional months was granted to allow healing, before prosthetic restoration and functional loading. _	0
The level of peri-implant bone was evaluated 12 months after loading. _	0
In this review we discuss evidence for the role of epigenetics in neuroplasticity and the implications for stroke recovery. @	1
Ischemic stroke is a devastating brain injury and an important cause of neurologic disability worldwide and across the lifespan. `	0
Despite the physical, social, and economic burdens of this disease there is only a single approved medicine for the treatment of acute stroke, and its use is unfortunately limited to the small fraction of patients presenting within the narrow therapeutic window. `	0
Following stroke, there is a period of plasticity involving cell genesis, axon growth, and synaptic modulation that is essential to spontaneous recovery. _	0
Treatments focusing on neuroprotection and enhancing recovery have been the focus of intense preclinical studies, but translation of these treatments into clinical use has been disappointing thus far. _	0
The important role of epigenetic mechanisms in disease states is becoming increasingly apparent, including in ischemic stroke. @	0
These regulators of gene expression are poised to be critical mediators of recovery following stroke. @	0
By considering the intermediate and light flavor branes interacting with baryon vertex homogeneously distributed along R^3 space and requesting the energy minimization, we find that there is a well defined transition density as a function of current quark mass. @	1
We also find that as density goes up very high, intermediate (or heavy) and light quarks populate equally as expected from the Pauli principle. @	1
In this sense, the effect of the Pauli principle is realized as dynamics of D-branes. @	1
We construct a simple holographic QCD model to study nuclear matter to strange matter transition. `	0
The interaction of dense medium and hadrons is taken care of by imposing the force balancing condition for stable D4/D6/D6 configuration. _	0
Combined PTF and INDO pretreatment of anesthetized, mechanically ventilated piglets infused with GBS (1.25 x 109 colony forming units/ kg/h) for 4 h prevented GBS-induced increases in Ppa at 1 h (GBS+PTF+INDO: 1.8 $$ 0.07 kPa versus GBS alone: 4.7 ± 0.1 kPa) and markedly attenuated increases in Ppa at 4 h (GBS+PTF+INDO: 2.1 ± 0.1 kPa versus GBS alone: 4.4 ± 0.1 kPa). _	1
PTF+INDO treatment prevented GBS-induced reductions in both mixed venous oxygen pressure and Pao2 at 1, 2, and 4 h (GBS+PTF+INDO: 11.5 ± 0.4 kPa versus GBS alone: 7.1 ± 0.4 kPa), and attenuated GBS-induced declines in cardiac output. _	1
PTF+INDO treatment significantly attenuated GBS-induced serum TNF$$ polypeptide levels (ELISA, pg/mL) at 4 h (GBS+PTF+INDO: 143 ± 45 versus GBS alone: 502 ± 147) and blocked GBS-induced increases in serum TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1% (all levels < 10 pg/0.1 mL by RIA). _	1
INDO pretreatment alone prevented GBS-induced increases in serum TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1$$* levels but did not significantly inhibit GBS-induced TNF$$ production. @	1
INDO pretreatment alone did not attenuate GBS-induced increases in Ppa at 4 h, nor prevent late-phase reductions in both Pao2 and mixed venous oxygen pressure. @	1
PTF+INDO treatment of GBS sepsis in piglets is superior to treatment with INDO or PTF alone. @	1
ABSTRACT: Group B streptococcus (GBS), a common neonatal gram-positive pathogen, causes similar pathophysiology in human newborns and neonatal animal models of sepsis. `	0
Animal models of GBS sepsis demonstrate a two-phase response: 1) an acute phase (<1 h) of increased pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) and reduced arterial oxygen pressure (Pao2) that is associated with increased serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and 2) a late phase (2–4 h) of persistently increased Ppa and reduced Pao2, reduced systemic arterial pressure, and progressive fall in cardiac output that is associated with increased serum TxB2, 6-keto-prostaglandin Fl$$ (6-keto-PGFi$$), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF$$). `	0
We hypothesized that pretreatment of piglets with both pentoxifylline (PTF), an inhibitor of TNF$$ production and activity, and indomethacin (INDO) would 1) inhibit GBS-induced TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1%, and TNF“ and 2) prevent both the acute- and late-phase physiologic responses of GBS sepsis. `	0
Inhibition of both blood eicosanoid and TNF$$ production may provide adjunctive therapy for human newborns with sepsis and pulmonary hypertension. @	0
RESULTS We systematically evaluated the transferability of predictive models and signature genes between microarray and RNA-seq using two large clinical data sets. _	1
The complexity of cross-platform sequence correspondence was considered in the analysis and examined using three human and two rat data sets, and three levels of mapping complexity were revealed. _	1
CONCLUSIONS Signature genes of predictive models are reciprocally transferable between microarray and RNA-seq data for model development, and microarray-based models can accurately predict RNA-seq-profiled samples; while RNA-seq-based models are less accurate in predicting microarray-profiled samples and are affected both by the choice of modeling algorithm and the gene mapping complexity. @	1
The results suggest continued usefulness of legacy microarray data and established microarray biomarkers and predictive models in the forthcoming RNA-seq era. @	1
BACKGROUND Gene expression microarray has been the primary biomarker platform ubiquitously applied in biomedical research, resulting in enormous data, predictive models, and biomarkers accrued. `	0
Recently, RNA-seq has looked likely to replace microarrays, but there will be a period where both technologies co-exist. `	0
This raises two important questions: Can microarray-based models and biomarkers be directly applied to RNA-seq data? `	0
Can future RNA-seq-based predictive models and biomarkers be applied to microarray data to leverage past investment? _	0
Three algorithms representing different modeling complexity were applied to the three levels of mappings for each of the eight binary endpoints and Cox regression was used to model survival times with expression data. @	0
In total, 240,096 predictive models were examined. @	0
To evaluate the effect of IR and prospective heteromerization on β(2)AR properties, we showed that IR coexpression had no effect on the ligand binding properties of β(2)AR; however, IR reduced β(2)AR surface expression and accelerated its internalization. `	1
Additionally, both receptors displayed a similar distribution pattern with a high degree of colocalization. `	1
To test the possible direct interaction between β(2)AR and IR, we employed quantitative BRET(2) saturation and competition assays. _	1
Saturation assay data suggested constitutive β(2)AR and IR homo- and heteromerization. _	1
Calculated acceptor/donor (AD50) values as a measure of the relative affinity for homo- and heteromer formation differed among the heteromers that could not be explained by a simple dimer model. _	1
In heterologous competition assays, a transient increase in the BRET(2) signal with a subsequent hyperbolical decrease was observed, suggesting higher-order heteromer formation. _	1
To complement the BRET(2) data, we employed the informational spectrum method (ISM), a virtual spectroscopy method to investigate protein-protein interactions. @	1
Computational peptide scanning of β(2)AR and IR identified intracellular domains encompassing residues at the end of the 7th TM domain and C-terminal tail of β(2)AR and a cytoplasmic part of the IR β chain as prospective interaction domains. @	1
ISM further suggested a high probability of heteromer formation and homodimers as basic units engaged in heteromerization. @	1
In summary, our data suggest direct interaction and higher-order β(2)AR:IR oligomer formation, likely comprising heteromers of homodimers. @	1
Glucose metabolism is under the cooperative regulation of both insulin receptor (IR) and β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR), which represent the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), respectively. `	0
Studies demonstrating cross-talk between these two receptors and their endogenous coexpression have suggested their possible interactions. `	0
Our data demonstrate that WDFY3 is highly expressed at the growth plate of neonatal mice and is expressed in osteoclasts in vitro cultures. _	1
Osteoclasts derived from WDFY3 conditional knockout mice (Wdfy3(loxP/loxP)-LysM-Cre(+)) demonstrated increased osteoclast differentiation as evidenced by higher number and enlarged size of TRAP(+) multinucleated cells. _	1
Western blot analysis also revealed up-regulation of TRAF6 and an increase in RANKL-induced NF-κB signaling in WDFY3-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages compared to wild type cultures. @	1
Consistent with these observations WDFY3-deficient cells also demonstrated an increase in osteoclast-related genes Ctsk, Acp5, Mmp9 and an increase of dentine resorption in in vitro assays. @	1
Importantly, in vivo RANKL gene transfer exacerbated bone loss in WDFY3 conditional knockout mice, as evidenced by elevated serum TRAP, CTX-I and micro-CT analysis of distal femurs compared to wild type littermates. @	1
Taken together, our data highlight a novel role for WDFY3 in osteoclast development and function, which can be exploited for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. @	1
Recently, autophagy-related proteins were shown to regulate osteoclast mediated bone resorption, a critical process in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. `	0
However, the role of autophagy-linked FYVE containing protein, WDFY3, in osteoclast biology remains elusive. `	0
WDFY3 is a master regulator in selective autophagy for clearing ubiquitinated protein aggregates and has been linked with rheumatoid arthritis. `	0
Herein, we used a series of WDFY3 transgenic mice (Wdfy3(lacZ) and Wdfy3(loxP)) to investigate the function of WDFY3 in osteoclast development and function. _	0
The AEtLP treated rats showed an increase in the number of stools, mucosa thickness, flat luminal surface thickness, mucin secretion, and crypt number. `	1
Overall, compared to the controls, 581 genes were up-regulated and 216 genes were down-regulated by the constipation induced by loperamide in the constipated rats. `	1
After the AEtLP treatment, 67 genes were up-regulated and 421 genes were down-regulated. _	1
Among the transcripts up-regulated by constipation, 89 were significantly down-regulated and 22 were recovered to the normal levels by the AEtLP treatment. _	1
The major genes in the down-regulated categories included Slc9a5, klk10, Fgf15, and Alpi, whereas the major genes in the recovered categories were Cyp2b2, Ace, G6pc, and Setbp1. _	1
On the other hand, after the AEtLP treatment, ten of these genes down-regulated by constipation were up-regulated significantly and five were recovered to the normal levels. @	1
The major genes in the up-regulated categories included Serpina3n, Lcn2 and Slc5a8, whereas the major genes in the recovered categories were Tmem45a, Rerg and Rgc32. @	1
These results indicate that several gene functional groups and individual genes as constipation biomarkers respond to an AEtLP treatment in constipated model rats. @	1
To characterize the changes in global gene expression in the distal colon of constipated SD rats in response to the laxative effects of aqueous extracts of Liriope platyphylla (AEtLP), including isoflavone, saponin, oligosaccharide, succinic acid and hydroxyproline, the total RNA extracted from the distal colon of AEtLP-treated constipation rats was hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays. `	0
RESULTS We located the first draining lymph node or nodes from metastases or local recurrences; we named them "metinel nodes." @	1
Lymphocytes from the metinel nodes proliferated, showed clonal expansion, and produced interferon gamma (via in vitro expansions on stimulation with tumor homogenate) and interleukins, all of which demonstrate the characteristics of tumor-reactive lymphocytes. @	1
Eight of the nineteen patients received immunotherapy on the basis of tumor-reactive T cells derived from the metinel nodes. @	1
CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that it is possible to locate the first lymph nodes draining subcutaneous, lymphatic, and visceral metastases, the so-called metinel nodes. @	1
Metinel node-derived lymphocytes may be used to treat disseminated solid cancer, and clinical trials should evaluate the effect of such treatment. @	1
BACKGROUND We previously identified tumor-reactive lymphocytes in the first lymph nodes that drain the primary tumor. `	0
In this study, we performed lymphatic mapping to investigate the possibility of finding the first lymph nodes that drain metastases, and of learning whether these lymph nodes contained tumor-reactive lymphocytes suitable for adoptive immunotherapy. `	0
METHODS Nineteen patients were studied. `	0
The primary tumor site was colorectal cancer in seven patients, malignant melanoma in four, ovarian cancer and breast cancer in two, and one each with pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cellular cancer of the tongue. _	0
By injection of Patent blue dye or radioactive tracers around the metastases, we identified draining lymph nodes from liver metastases (n = 9), intra-abdominal local recurrences (n = 3), and regional lymph node metastases (n = 7). _	0
In six patients, a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed. _	0
We prove that their results extend to the case when $a_n=o(n)$ and $b_n=o(n)$. _	1
We also consider the case when $\frac{a_n}{n} \to p \in (0,1)$ and $(a_n-b_n)^2= \Theta(a_n+b_n)$. _	1
Observe that in this case $\frac{b_n}{n} \to p$ also. @	1
We show that here the models are mutually contiguous if $(a_n-b_n)^2<2(1-p)(a_n+b_n)$ and they are asymptotically singular if $(a_n-b_n)^2>2(1-p)(a_n+b_n)$. @	1
Further we also prove it is impossible find an estimate of the labeling of the nodes which is positively correlated with the true labeling whenever $(a_n-b_n)^2<2(1-p)(a_n+b_n)$. @	1
The results of this paper justify the negative part of a conjecture made in Decelle et al. @	1
(2011) for dense graphs. @	1
We consider the two block stochastic block model on $n$ nodes with asymptotically equal cluster sizes. `	0
The connection probabilities within and between cluster are denoted by $p_n:=\frac{a_n}{n}$ and $q_n:=\frac{b_n}{n}$ respectively. `	0
Mossel et al. `	0
(2012) considered the case when $a_n=a$ and $b_n=b$ are fixed. `	0
They proved the probability models of the stochastic block model and that of Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi graph with same average degree are mutually contiguous whenever $(a-b)^2<2(a+b)$ and are asymptotically singular whenever $(a-b)^2>2(a+b)$. `	0
Mossel et al. _	0
(2012) also proved that when $(a-b)^2<2(a+b)$ no algorithm is able to find an estimate of the labeling of the nodes which is positively correlated with the true labeling. _	0
It is natural to ask what happens when $a_n$ and $b_n$ both grow to infinity. _	0
We investigate whether acetylation alters the architecture of microtubules or the conformation of tubulin, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). _	1
No significant changes are observed based on protofilament distributions or microtubule helical lattice parameters. _	1
Furthermore, no clear differences in tubulin structure are detected between cryo-EM reconstructions of maximally deacetylated or acetylated microtubules. _	1
Our results indicate that the effect of acetylation must be highly localized and affect interaction with proteins that bind directly to the lumen of the microtubule. @	1
We also investigate the interaction of the tubulin acetyltransferase, αTAT1, with microtubules and find that αTAT1 is able to interact with the outside of the microtubule, at least partly through the tubulin C-termini. @	1
Binding to the outside surface of the microtubule could facilitate access of αTAT1 to its luminal site of action if microtubules undergo lateral opening between protofilaments. @	1
Tubulin undergoes posttranslational modifications proposed to specify microtubule subpopulations for particular functions. `	0
Most of these modifications occur on the C-termini of tubulin and may directly affect the binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) or motors. `	0
Acetylation of Lys-40 on α-tubulin is unique in that it is located on the luminal surface of microtubules, away from the interaction sites of most MAPs and motors. `	0
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our results show that CD4 and CD8 T cells directed to epitopes in the same antigen differ both in their kinetics and functional characteristics throughout an infection with M. tuberculosis. @	1
In addition, the observed strong expansion of CD8 T cells in the late stages of infection could have implications for the development of post exposure vaccines against latent TB. @	1
BACKGROUND Recently we and others have identified CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes within the highly expressed M. tuberculosis protein TB10.4. `	0
This has enabled, for the first time, a comparative study of the dynamics and function of CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for epitopes within the same protein in various stages of TB infection. `	0
METHODS AND FINDINGS We focused on T cells directed to two epitopes in TB10.4; the MHC class I restricted epitope TB10.4 (3-11) (CD8/10.4 T cells) and the MHC class II restricted epitope TB10.4 (74-88) (CD4/10.4 T cells). `	0
CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells displayed marked differences in terms of expansion and contraction in a mouse TB model. _	0
CD4/10.4 T cells dominated in the early phase of infection whereas CD8/10.4 T cells were expanded after week 16 and reached 5-8 fold higher numbers in the late phase of infection. _	0
In the early phase of infection both CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells were characterized by 20-25% polyfunctional cells (IL-2(+), IFN-gamma(+), TNF-alpha(+)), but whereas the majority of CD4/10.4 T cells were maintained as polyfunctional T cells throughout infection, CD8/10.4 T cells differentiated almost exclusively into effector cells (IFN-gamma(+), TNF-alpha(+)). _	0
Both CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells exhibited cytotoxicity in vivo in the early phase of infection, but whereas CD4/10.4 cell mediated cytotoxicity waned during the infection, CD8/10.4 T cells exhibited increasing cytotoxic potential throughout the infection. @	0
Results from the analysis indicated a new engine design was necessary to sustain highly TC operation. _	1
Dry sump lubrication was implemented after initial oil surge problems were found with the wet sump system during vehicle testing.The design and development of the system is outlined, together with brake performance effects for the varying systems.Tuning an odd fire engine with an intake restriction and upstream throttle location was explored together with varying injector locations and manifold geometry. @	1
To improve engine efficiency, turbocharging and specific engine downsizing were employed in conjunction with a lean burn strategy at low brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). @	1
This engine package and tuning strategy resulted in the Melbourne University Formula SAE vehicle being very successful in competition, finishing first in the fuel economy event at the 2004 Australasian competition. @	1
Peak BMEP values of 25 bar, believed to be the highest recorded for small engines on pump gasoline were also achieved. @	1
ABSTRACTThis paper describes the mechanical component design, lubrication, tuning and control aspects of a restricted, odd fire, highly turbocharged (TC) engine for Formula SAE competition. `	0
The engine was specifically designed and configured for the purpose, being a twin cylinder inline arrangement with double overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. `	0
Most of the engine components were specially cast or machined from billets.A detailed theoretical analysis was completed to determine engine specifications and operating conditions. _	0
RESULTS MG- and SG-feature sets are transferable and perform well for training and testing prediction of metastasis outcome in strictly independent data sets, both between different and within similar microarray platforms, while classifiers had a poorer performance when validated in strictly independent datasets. _	1
The study showed that MG- and SG-feature sets perform equally well in classifying independent data. @	1
Furthermore, SG-classifiers significantly outperformed MG-classifier when validation is conducted between datasets using similar platforms, while no significant performance difference was found when validation was performed between different platforms. @	1
CONCLUSION Prediction of metastasis outcome in lymph node-negative patients by MG- and SG-classifiers showed that SG-classifiers performed significantly better than MG-classifiers when validated in independent data based on the same microarray platform as used for developing the classifier. @	1
However, the MG- and SG-classifiers had similar performance when conducting classifier validation in independent data based on a different microarray platform. @	1
The latter was also true when only validating sets of MG- and SG-features in independent datasets, both between and within similar and different platforms. @	1
BACKGROUND The popularity of a large number of microarray applications has in cancer research led to the development of predictive or prognostic gene expression profiles. `	0
However, the diversity of microarray platforms has made the full validation of such profiles and their related gene lists across studies difficult and, at the level of classification accuracies, rarely validated in multiple independent datasets. `	0
Frequently, while the individual genes between such lists may not match, genes with same function are included across such gene lists. `	0
Development of such lists does not take into account the fact that genes can be grouped together as metagenes (MGs) based on common characteristics such as pathways, regulation, or genomic location. `	0
Such MGs might be used as features in building a predictive model applicable for classifying independent data. `	0
It is, therefore, demanding to systematically compare independent validation of gene lists or classifiers based on metagene or individual gene (SG) features. _	0
METHODS In this study we compared the performance of either metagene-or single gene-based feature sets and classifiers using random forest and two support vector machines for classifier building. _	0
The performance within the same dataset, feature set validation performance, and validation performance of entire classifiers in strictly independent datasets were assessed by 10 times repeated 10-fold cross validation, leave-one-out cross validation, and one-fold validation, respectively. _	0
To test the significance of the performance difference between MG- and SG-features/classifiers, we used a repeated down-sampled binomial test approach. _	0
Our data shows potential interaction between IFN-γ and TLR2 responses in hPDLSCs, which might be involved in regulation of immune response in inflammatory diseases, and particularly periodontitis. @	1
Periodontal ligament stem cells similarly to the mesenchymal stem cells of other tissues possess immunomodulatory properties, which are regulated by different cytokines, particularly by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). `	0
In contrast, less information is provided about the effect of toll-like receptors ligand on immunomodulatory properties of these cells. `	0
In the present study we investigated the response of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) in response to simultaneous stimulation with IFN-γ and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. `	0
The resulting expression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) was investigated. _	0
The expression of IDO-1 was upregulated by IFN-γ in both gene and protein levels. _	0
TLR2 agonists Pam3CSK4 induced gene expression of IDO-1, but had no effect on protein expression. _	0
IFN-γ induced IDO-1 protein expression was further enhanced by Pam3CSK4. @	0
TLR-4 agonist E. coli LPS has no significant effect on neither basal nor IFN-γ induced IDO-1 protein expression. @	0
The production of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 was induced by TLR agonists. @	0
Neither basal nor TLR agonists induced production of these proteins was affected by IFN-γ. @	0
Two situations were compared: 1) A real-life situation in which persons at high SCORE-risk were identified through clinical case-finding and, 2) A theoretical maximum situation where universal screening was implemented resulting in known SCORE-risks for the whole Dutch population aged 35-75 years (8.4 million people). _	1
Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the cholesterol-lowering effect and intake level of phytosterols/-stanols, indirect health care costs, time horizon and discount rates. _	1
This simulation study showed that the cost-effectiveness of phytosterols/-stanols as monotherapy and as add-on to statins is above thresholds for cost-effectiveness, generally ranging between €20,000 and €50,000, and is thus a non-cost-effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease. @	1
The present modelling study aimed to evaluate if and by how much functional foods containing phytosterols/-stanols add to the benefits of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in terms of cost-effectiveness. `	0
Long-term health effects, measured as quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs for scenarios with additional phytosterol/-stanol use were compared to scenarios without extra use. `	0
Phytosterols/-stanols were given only to persons who were eligible for use according to their 10-year absolute risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (SCORE-risk). `	0
Intake levels and discontinuation rates as observed in daily practice were included in the model. _	0
At the model's start year, a total of 1.0 (real-life situation) to 3.3 (maximum situation) million persons qualified for phytosterol/-stanol use based on their SCORE-risk (both statin users and statin non-users). @	0
Over the model's time horizon, this resulted in a gain of 2700 to 16,300 quality-adjusted life-years, and yielded cost-effectiveness ratios that ranged between €92,000 and €203,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. @	0
KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE Neurotoxic snake envenomation can result in respiratory failure and death. `	1
Early treatment is considered important to survival. _	1
An experiment using aerosolized neostigmine to reverse paralysis suggests how early interventions could be developed. @	1
Inexpensive, heat-stable, needle-free, antiparalytics could facilitate early treatment of snakebite and save lives, but none have been developed. @	0
The cells responded to odorants with changes in firing frequency and alterations in excitability that were detected with tight-seal patch electrodes using on-cell and whole-cell recording conditions. `	1
Chemosensitive cells exhibited two primary response characteristics: excitation and inhibition. _	1
Both types of primary response were observed in different cells stimulated by mixtures of amino acids as well as by the single compound L-alanine, suggesting that there may be more than one transduction pathway for some odorants. _	1
Using the normal whole-cell recording method, the chemosensitivity of competent cells washed out rapidly; a resistive whole-cell method was used to record odorant responses under current-clamp conditions. @	1
In response to chemical stimulation, excitability appeared to be modulated in several different ways in different cells: odorants induced hyperpolarizing or depolarizing receptor potentials, elicited or inhibited transient, rhythmic generator potentials, and altered excitability without changing the membrane potential or input resistance. @	1
These effects suggest that olfactory transduction is mediated through at least three different pathways with effects on four or more components of the membrane conductance. @	1
Polychotomous pathways such as these may be important for odor discrimination and for sharpening the "odor image" generated in the olfactory epithelium. @	1
Olfactory receptor neurons were isolated without enzymes from the mudpuppy, Necturus maculosus, and tested for chemosensitivity. `	0
Here we report five new examples of heterozygote advantage, based around polymorphisms in the BMP15 and GDF9 genes that affect female fecundity in domesticated sheep and are not reliant on disease for their maintenance. `	1
Five separate mutations in these members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily give phenotypes with fitness differentials characteristic of heterozygous advantage. _	1
In each case, one copy of the mutant allele increases ovulation rate, and ultimately litter size per ewe lambing, relative to the wildtype. _	1
However, homozygous ewes inheriting mutant alleles from both parents have impaired oocyte development and maturation, which results in small undeveloped ovaries and infertility. _	1
Using data collected over many years on ovulation rates, litter size, and lambing rates, we have calculated the equilibrium solution for each of these polymorphisms using standard population genetic theory. @	1
The predicted equilibrium frequencies obtained for these mutant alleles range from 0.11 to 0.23, which are amongst the highest yet reported for a polymorphism maintained by heterozygote advantage. @	1
These are amongst the most frequent and compelling examples of heterozygote advantage yet described and the first documented examples of heterozygote advantage that are not reliant on a disease interaction for their maintenance. @	1
Heterozygote advantage, or overdominance, remains a popular and persuasive explanation for the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations in the face of selection. `	0
However, despite being first proposed more than 80 years ago, there remain few examples that fit the criteria for heterozygote advantage, all of which are associated with disease resistance and are maintained only in the presence of disease or other gene-by-environment interaction. `	0
The calibration model combines a Gaussian process emulator of the likelihood surface with importance sampling. _	1
Changing the discrepancy specification changes only the importance weights, which lets us investigate sensitivity to different discrepancy specifications at little computational cost. _	1
We present a case study of a natural history model that has been used to characterise UK bowel cancer incidence. @	1
Data sets and computer code are provided as supplementary material. @	1
AbstractWe calibrate a stochastic computer simulation model of 'moderate' computational expense. `	0
The simulator is an imperfect representation of reality, and we recognise this discrepancy to ensure a reliable calibration. `	0
We show that amygdala responses depend on visual awareness. _	1
Under conditions in which subjects were not aware of fearful faces flashed for 33 ms, no differential activation was observed in the amygdala. @	1
On the other hand, differential activation was observed for 67 ms fearful targets that the subjects could reliably detect. @	1
When trials were divided into hits, misses, correct rejects, and false alarms, we show that target visibility is an important factor in determining amygdala responses to fearful faces. @	1
Taken together, our results further challenge the view that amygdala responses occur automatically. @	1
The goals of the present study were twofold. `	0
First, we wished to investigate the neural correlates of aware and unaware emotional face perception after characterizing each subject's behavioral performance via signal detection theory methods. `	0
Second, we wished to investigate the extent to which amygdala responses to fearful faces depend on the physical characteristics of the stimulus independently of the percept. _	0
Here, to evade this issue, we adopted a novel, mutator Ad polymerase-based, 'accelerated-evolution' approach that can serve as general method to generate or optimize adenoviral vectors. `	1
First, we site specifically substituted Ad polymerase residues located in either the nucleotide binding pocket or the exonuclease domain. _	1
This yielded several polymerase mutants that, while fully supportive of viral replication, increased Ad's intrinsic mutation rate. _	1
Mutator activities of these mutants were revealed by performing deep sequencing on pools of replicated viruses. _	1
The strongest identified mutators carried replacements of residues implicated in ssDNA binding at the exonuclease active site. _	1
Next, we exploited these mutators to generate the genetic diversity required for directed Ad evolution. @	1
Using this new forward genetics approach, we isolated viral mutants with improved cytolytic activity. @	1
These mutants revealed a common mutation in a splice acceptor site preceding the gene for the adenovirus death protein (ADP). @	1
Accordingly, the isolated viruses showed high and untimely expression of ADP, correlating with a severe deregulation of E3 transcript splicing. @	1
Adenoviruses (Ads) are the most frequently used viruses for oncolytic and gene therapy purposes. `	0
Most Ad-based vectors have been generated through rational design. `	0
Although this led to significant vector improvements, it is often hampered by an insufficient understanding of Ad's intricate functions and interactions. `	0
We have determined the coupling constant of the DM interaction and have given a complete quantitative account for the field dependence of the spin gaps along all three principal axes, without resorting to additional interactions such as interchain coupling. @	1
We have investigated the physical effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in copper benzoate. `	0
In the low-field limit, the spin gap is found to vary as H(2/3)ln((1/6)(J/mu(B)H(s)) (H(s): an effective staggered field induced by the external field H) in agreement with the prediction of conformal field theory, while the staggered magnetization varies as H(1/3) and the ln((1/3)(J/mu(B)H(s)) correction predicted by conformal field theory is not confirmed. _	0
The linear scaling relation between the momentum shift and the magnetization is broken. @	0
A crossover to strong applied field behavior is predicted for further experimental verification. @	0
Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. _	1
Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. @	1
Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = −4.3; 95 % CI −8.1 to −0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.1), whole fruit (β = −0.9; 95 % CI −1.6 to −0.2), and total protein (β = −0.7; 95 % CI −1.3 to −0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI −4.3 to −0.1). @	1
Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality. @	1
Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. `	0
The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. `	0
We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. `	0
Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20–44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2012. `	0
Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (≤6 h), adequate (7–8 h), or long (≥9 h). _	0
The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0–100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. _	0
Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. _	0
The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. @	0
In this work we bring together these two lines of research by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a sequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions. _	1
In this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics of quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be well described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable equilibrium state. _	1
We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i) the time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable models. @	1
For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy production, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of optimal work extraction protocols. @	1
While we keep the discussion general, much room is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic quantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with respect to the role of the minimal work principle. @	1
Our work not only has implications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as suggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external heat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of freedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium. @	1
Recent years have seen an enormously revived interest in the study of thermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. `	0
This applies both to the study of notions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well as to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum many-body systems as such. `	0
In this paper, Raman micro-spectrometry reveals the presence of organic contamination onto the surface obtained from the use of epoxy resin, specifically Araldite. _	1
This contamination level varies depending on otolith structures. _	1
Core and checks, known as structural discontinuities, exhibit the most important level of contaminations. _	1
Our results suggest that otolith embedding with resin affects the organic matrix of the otolith, probably through an infiltration of the resin in the crystalline structure. @	1
The interpretation of chemical otolith signatures, especially Raman otolith signatures, and stable isotope analyses should then be revised in light of these results. @	1
In this respect, we propose a method for the correction of Raman otolith signatures for contamination effects. @	1
The high spatial resolution analysis of the mineral and organic composition of otoliths using Raman micro-spectrometry involves rigorous protocols for sample preparation previously established for microchemistry and trace elements analyses. `	0
These protocols often include otolith embedding in chemically neutral resin (i.e., resins which do not contain, in detectable concentration, elements usually sought in the otoliths). `	0
Such embedding may however induce organic contamination. `	0
Compared with no attendance, at least weekly attendance of religious services was associated with greater life satisfaction and positive affect, a number of character strengths, lower probabilities of marijuana use and early sexual initiation, and fewer lifetime sexual partners. @	1
Analyses of prayer or meditation yielded similar results. @	1
Although decisions about religion are not shaped principally by health, encouraging service attendance and private practices in adolescents who already hold religious beliefs may be meaningful avenues of development and support, possibly leading to better health and well-being. @	1
In the present study, we prospectively examined the associations of religious involvement in adolescence (including religious service attendance and prayer or meditation) with a wide array of psychological well-being, mental health, health behavior, physical health, and character strength outcomes in young adulthood. `	0
Longitudinal data from the Growing Up Today Study were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. `	0
Sample sizes ranged from 5,681 to 7,458, depending on outcome; the mean baseline age was 14.74 years, and there were 8-14 years of follow-up (1999 to either 2007, 2010, or 2013). _	0
Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. _	0
All models were controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, maternal health, and prior values of the outcome variables whenever data were available. @	0
Research needs to pursue new avenues, focusing on exposure windows that have not yet been sufficiently explored, such as events between conception and adolescence, and on modifiable risk factors that show large variation within or between populations. @	1
Environmental factors play an important role in breast carcinogenesis. `	0
Opportunities for prevention are limited, however, because most of the known or suspected risk factors are not targets for modification. _	0
Dietary factors have generally not emerged as crucial contributors to mammary tumor causation. @	0
We still appear to be missing a critical piece of the breast cancer puzzle because we can only explain a moderate proportion of international and national variation in breast cancer rates. @	0
Here, we found that cluster analysis of the emotional behavior states of mice exposed to CSDS allowed their segregation into anxious and non-anxious groups. _	1
Endocannabinoid-mediated spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in the nucleus accumbens was attenuated in non-anxious mice and abolished in anxious mice. _	1
Anxiety-like behavior in stressed animals was specifically correlated with their ability to produce STDP. @	1
Pharmacological enhancement of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) signaling in the nucleus accumbens normalized the anxious phenotype and STDP in anxious mice. @	1
These data reveal that endocannabinoid modulation of synaptic efficacy in response to a naturalistic activity pattern is both a molecular correlate of behavioral adaptability and a crucial factor in the adaptive response to chronic stress. @	1
Chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) is a clinically relevant model of mood disorders. `	0
The relationship between the CSDS model and a physiologically pertinent paradigm of synaptic plasticity is not known. `	0
The characterization of Leishmania from a dog was done for the first time in Argentina. @	1
The importance of the intraspecific polymorphism in the induction of clinical forms and in the host-reservoir concept is briefly discussed, based on the zymodeme data of isolates from humans and dogs. @	1
The presence of L. (V.) guyanensis was confirmed in the country. @	1
Sixteen Leishmania stocks, 15 isolated from patients with cutaneous (CL), mucocutaneous (MCL), or recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis, plus one from a dog with CL in Salta and Corrientes Provinces, Argentina, were studied by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. `	0
Thirteen of the stocks from humans were grouped in two zymodemes; nine termed as KMS 1, four as KMS 2, and assigned to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. `	0
Two additional stocks from CL cases expressed a KMS 4 enzyme profile, corresponding to L. (V.) guyanensis. _	0
Although the parasites from the dog were also assigned to L. (V.) braziliensis, its zymodeme, KMS 3, was not expressed in any of the current human isolates. _	0
An explanation is offered regarding the variation of the principal point as a function of zoom setting based on these measurements. _	1
In addition the relationship of the decentering distortion to radial distortion, principal distance, and lens- image-plane misalignment angle is discussed. _	1
A technique for determining the proper point of symmetry to be used for distortion computations (as opposed to the principal point) is also suggested. _	1
A simple technique for measuring the misalignment angle of zoom lenses when attached to video cameras is presented, along with measurements for seven solid-state cameras. @	1
A method to reduce the additional error introduced by zoom lens misalignment is presented. @	1
The implications of this study are that special measures to properly align a zoom lens to the sensor image plane are probably not necessary, but that as the accuracy obtainable in digital photogrammetry approaches the 0.01 or less pixel level, additional calibration including the point of symmetry for distortion computation should be considered. @	1
This report summarizes an investigation of zoom lens calibration, with emphasis on the effects of lens-image-plane misalignment. `	0
Measurements have been made of the photogrammetric principal point and radial (symmetrical) and decentering (asymmetrical) distortion components as a function of the principal distance (zoom setting) of several zoom lenses. `	0
Data were also taken with the axis of symmetry (optical axis) of a zoom lens aligned and misaligned to the same solid-state video camera. `	0
