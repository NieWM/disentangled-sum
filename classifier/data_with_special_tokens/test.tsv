RESULTS Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) especially poses a zoonotic risk to people working in close contact with livestock. `	1
These people may become carriers themselves and the hazard of transmission into health-care facilities needs surveillance. _	1
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing bacteria are widely spread in both humans and livestock, sharing similar genotypes, especially of the CTX-M-group, which makes a zoonotic transfer very likely. _	1
Identical strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were found both in humans and animals, after ingestion of animal strains transient colonization of the human gut may be possible. _	1
Only a few data are available on the transmission of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) between humans and animals. _	1
Direct contact to colonized animals may be a risk factor as well as the exchange of resistance genes between human and animal staphylococci. @	1
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) ribotype 078 emerges in livestock and humans and a zoonotic transmission seems probable as genotypes and diseases resemble each other. @	1
CONCLUSION All discussed MRB and C. difficile are important nosocomial agents which also occur in livestock and were found in foods of animal origin. @	1
AIM Information on the epidemiology of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) with zoonotic potential is growing but still remains quite incomplete. `	0
This narrative mini-review provides a general overview of the epidemiology of the most important zoonotic MRB in cattle, swine and poultry in Europe. `	0
METHODS A literature search was conducted mainly on the PubMed website including articles published until April 2012. `	0
Further analysis is needed to reveal the exact transmission routes and to perform a reliable risk assessment. @	0
By using the interplay of the Eulerian idempotent and the Dynkin idempotent, we construct explicitly a particular symmetric solution (F,G) of the first equation of the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture: x+y-log(exp(y)exp(x))=(1-exp(-ad x))F(x,y)+(exp(ad y)-1)G(x,y) . `	1
Then, we explicit all the solutions of the equation in the completion of the free Lie algebra generated by two indeterminates x and y thanks to the kernel of the Dynkin idempotent. _	1
In this article, we review the clinical and genetic epidemiology of psoriasis with a brief description of the pathogenesis of disease. @	1
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated skin condition with a prevalence of 0–11.8 % across the world. `	0
It is associated with a number of cardiovascular, metabolic, and autoimmune disease comorbidities. `	0
Psoriasis is a multifactorial disorder, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. `	0
Its genetic basis has long been established through twin studies and familial clustering. _	0
The association of psoriasis with the HLA-Cw6 allele has been shown in many studies. _	0
Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a large number of other genes associated with psoriasis. _	0
Many of these genes regulate the innate and adaptive immune system. @	0
These findings indicate that a dysregulated immune system may play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. @	0
It is shown here that that concern is unjustified: inflation proceeds as usual if we adopt the trace free gravitational equations. @	1
The trace-free version of the Einstein Gravitational equations, essentially equivalent to unimodular gravity, can solve the troubling issue of the huge discrepancy between quantum field theory estimates of the vacuum energy density and the astronomically observed value of the cosmological constant. `	0
However it has been suggested that this proposal cannot work because it prevents the inflaton potential energy from driving inflation. _	0
We describe the epidemiology of deaths associated with bacterial pathogens using data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) in the United States. `	1
CONCLUSIONS Salmonella and Listeria remain the leading causes of death in the United States due to bacterial pathogens transmitted commonly through food. @	1
Most such deaths occurred in persons ≥65 years old, indicating that this age group could benefit from effective food safety interventions. @	1
BACKGROUND Foodborne diseases are typically mild and self-limiting but can cause severe illness and death. `	0
METHODS We analyzed FoodNet data from 1996-2005 to determine the numbers and rates of deaths occurring within 7-days of laboratory-confirmation. `	0
RESULTS During 1996-2005, FoodNet ascertained 121,536 cases of laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections, including 552 (.5%) deaths, of which 215 (39%) and 168 (30%) were among persons infected with Salmonella and Listeria, respectively. _	0
The highest age-specific average annual population mortality rates were in older adults (≥65 years) for all pathogens except Shigella, for which the highest age-specific average annual population mortality rate was in children <5 years (.2/1 million population). _	0
Overall, most deaths (58%; 318) occurred in persons ≥65 years old. _	0
Listeria had the highest case fatality rate overall (16.9%), followed by Vibrio (5.8%), Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (0.8%), Salmonella (0.5%), Campylobacter (0.1%), and Shigella (0.1%). @	0
We then prove that; (1) when $H$ is the Krasner hyperfield, $X(H)$ is homeomorphic to the underlying space of $X$, (2) when $H$ is the tropical hyperfield and $X$ is of finite type over a complete non-Archimedean valued field $k$, $X(H)$ is homeomorphic to the underlying space of the Berkovich analytificaiton $X^{\textrm{an}}$ of $X$, and (3) when $H$ is the hyperfield of signs, $X(H)$ is homeomorphic to the underlying space of the real scheme $X_r$ associated with $X$. _	1
Given a scheme $X$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ and a hyperfield $H$ which is equipped with topology, we endow the set $X(H)$ of $H$-rational points with a natural topology. `	0
In this review, we summarize studies using MmuPV1 over the past six years and share our perspectives on the value of this unique model system. @	1
Specifically, we discuss viral pathogenesis in cutaneous and mucosal tissues as well as in different mouse strains, immune responses to the virus, and local host-restricted factors that may be involved in MmuPV1 infections and associated disease progression. @	1
The mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) was first reported in 2011 and has since become a powerful research tool. `	0
Through collective efforts from different groups, significant progress has been made in the understanding of molecular, virological, and immunological mechanisms of MmuPV1 infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts. `	0
This mouse papillomavirus provides, for the first time, the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in the context of a small common laboratory animal for which abundant reagents are available and for which many strains exist. _	0
The model is a major step forward in the study of papillomavirus disease and pathology. _	0
Two EVAR clinical cases were numerically reproduced by simulating stent-graft models deployment inside the tortuous arterial model generated from patient pre-operative scan. _	1
In the same manner, an in vitro stent-graft deployment in a rigid polymer phantom, generated by extracting the arterial geometry from the preoperative scan of a patient, was simulated to assess the influence of biomechanical environment unknowns in the in vivo case. @	1
Results were validated by comparing stent positions on simulations and post-operative scans. @	1
In all cases, simulation predicted stents deployed locations and shapes with an accuracy of a few millimetres. @	1
The good results obtained in the in vitro case validated the ability of the methodology to simulate stent-graft deployment in very tortuous arteries and led to think proper modelling of biomechanical environment could reduce the few local discrepancies found in the in vivo case. @	1
In conclusion, this study proved that our methodology can achieve accurate simulation of stent-graft deployed shape even in tortuous patient specific aortic aneurysms and may be potentially helpful to help practitioners plan their intervention. @	1
The rate of post-operative complications is the main drawback of endovascular repair, a technique used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. `	0
Complex anatomies, featuring short aortic necks and high vessel tortuosity for instance, have been proved likely prone to these complications. `	0
In this context, practitioners could benefit, at the preoperative planning stage, from a tool able to predict the post-operative position of the stent-graft, to validate their stent-graft sizing and anticipate potential complications. `	0
In consequence, the aim of this work is to prove the ability of a numerical simulation methodology to reproduce accurately the shapes of stent-grafts, with a challenging design, deployed inside tortuous aortic aneurysms. _	0
Stent-graft module samples were scanned by X-ray microtomography and subjected to mechanical tests to generate finite-element models. _	0
Results Behavioral results showed enhanced feelings of social exclusion in both patient groups as compared to healthy controls but only the NSSI group showed enhanced activation during social exclusion versus inclusion compared to the other groups. @	1
While both NSSI and BPD groups showed enhanced activation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex during social exclusion as compared to their age-matched controls, enhanced activation during social inclusion as compared to a passive watching condition was mainly observed in the BPD group in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula. @	1
Discussion While neural processing of social exclusion was pronounced in adolescents with NSSI, BPD patients also showed increased activity in a per se positive social situation. @	1
Introduction Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD). `	0
However, NSSI often occurs independently of BPD. `	0
Altered neural processing of social exclusion has been shown in adolescents with NSSI and adults with BPD with additional alterations during social inclusion in BPD patients. `	0
Aims of this study were to investigate differences in neural processing of social inclusion and exclusion situations between adolescents with NSSI and young adults with BPD and NSSI. _	0
Methods Using fMRI, neural processing of positive and negative social situations (paradigm: "Cyberball") was explored. _	0
Participants were 14 adolescents with NSSI, but without BPD (Mage = 15.4; SD = 1.9), 15 adults with BPD and NSSI (Mage = 23.3; SD = 4.1), as well as 15 healthy adolescents (Mage = 14.5; SD = 1.7), and 16 healthy adults (Mage = 23.2; SD = 4.4). _	0
These results might point toward a higher responsiveness to social exclusion in adolescents with NSSI, which might then develop into a generalized increased sensitivity to all kinds of social situations in adults with BPD. @	0
RESULTS Plasma l-methamphetamine levels were often below the level of quantification so bioavailability was estimated by comparing urinary excretion of the intravenous and inhaled doses, yielding delivered dose estimates of 74.0 +/- 56.1, 124.7 +/- 106.6, and 268.1 +/- 220.5 microg for ascending exposures (mean 4.2 +/- 3.3 microg/inhalation). @	1
Physiological changes were minimal and not dose-dependent. @	1
Small decreases in stroke volume and cardiac output suggesting mild cardiodepression were seen. @	1
CONCLUSION Inhaled l-methamphetamine delivered from a non-prescription product produced minimal effects but may be a cardiodepressant. @	1
BACKGROUND We studied the pharmacology of l-methamphetamine, the less abused isomer, when used as a nasal decongestant. `	0
METHODS 12 subjects self-administered l-methamphetamine from a nonprescription inhaler at the recommended dose (16 inhalations over 6 hours) then at 2 and 4 (32 and 64 inhalations) times this dose. `	0
In a separate session intravenous phenylephrine (200 microg) and l-methamphetamine (5 mg) were given to define alpha agonist pharmacology and bioavailability. _	0
Physiological, cardiovascular, pharmacokinetic, and subjective effects were measured. _	0
Here we report for the first time on a high-time-resolution study of the evolution of both bosonic and fermionic excitations through a second order electronic charge-ordering SBT in a condensed matter system. _	1
Using a new three-pulse femtosecond spectroscopy technique, we periodically quench our model system into the high-symmetry state, detecting hitherto unrecorded coherent aperiodic undulations of the order parameter (OP), critical slowing down of the collective mode, and evolution of the particle-hole gap appearing through the Peierls-BCS mechanism as the system evolves through the transition. _	1
Numerical modeling based on Ginzburg-Landau theory is used to reproduce the observations without free parameters. @	1
The close analogy with other Higgs potentials in particle physics\cite{Higgs} gives new insight into hitherto unexplored dynamics of both single particle and collective excitations through a SBT. @	1
Of particular interest is the observation of spectro-temporal distortions caused by disturbances of the field arising from spontaneous annihilation of topological defects, similar to those discussed by the Kibble-Zurek cosmological model. @	1
The temporal evolution of systems undergoing symmetry breaking phase transitions (SBTs) is of great fundamental interest not only in condensed matter physics, but extends from cosmology to brain function and finance \cite{topology,Kibble,Eltsov,Finance}. `	0
However, the study of such transitions is often hindered by the fact that they are difficult to repeat, or they occur very rapidly. `	0
The characteristics of central and peripheral arteries (arterial velocity pulse index (AVI) and arterial pressure volume index (API), respectively) and baPWV were measured. _	1
Estimated central BP (eCBP) was calculated from the data obtained from PASESA(®), and CBP was also measured simultaneously by invasive catheterization. _	1
RESULTS API, but not AVI and baPWV, in the SVD group was significantly higher than that in the non-SVD group. _	1
Although eCBP was significantly associated with CBP, there was no difference in eCBP between the groups. @	1
There were significant associations among API, AVI and baPWV, albeit these associations were relatively weak. @	1
A multivariate logistic regression revealed that API and β-blocker were significant independent variables that were associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis. @	1
The cut-off level of API that gave the greatest sensitivity and specificity for the presence of SVD was 24 units (sensitivity 0.636 and specificity 0.667). @	1
CONCLUSION In conclusion, API, but not AVI or baPWV, is associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis. @	1
BACKGROUND A blood pressure (BP) monitoring system (PASESA(®)) can be used to easily analyze the characteristics of central and peripheral arteries during the measurement of brachial BP. `	0
METHODS We enrolled 108 consecutive patients (M/F = 86/22, age 70 ± 10 years) who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) due to suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in whom we could measure various parameters using PASESA(®) in addition to brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). `	0
The patients were divided into two groups: patients who did not have significantly stenosed coronary vessel disease (n = 33, non-SVD group) and those who had at least one significantly stenosed coronary vessel (n = 75, SVD group). `	0
RESULTS The prevalence of CT was 39.1% in this patient cohort and incidence of CT was significantly higher in female patients than that in male patients (OR = 2.603, 95%CI 1.897, 3.607, P<0.001). @	1
CT was positively correlated with essential hypertension (OR = 1.533, 95%CI 1.131, 2.076, P = 0.006) and negatively correlated with CAD (OR = 0.755, 95%CI 0.574, 0.994, P = 0.045). @	1
MACE during follow up was similar between CAD patients with or without CT. @	1
CONCLUSIONS CT is more often seen in females and positively correlated with hypertension and negatively correlated with coronary atherosclerosis. @	1
BACKGROUND Coronary tortuosity (CT) is a common coronary angiography finding. `	0
The exact pathogenesis, clinical implication and long-term prognosis of CT are not fully understood. `	0
The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of CT in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. `	0
METHODS A total of 1010 consecutive patients underwent coronary angiography with complaints of chest pain or related symptoms were included in the present study (544 male, mean age: 64±11 years). _	0
CT was defined by the finding of ≥3 bends (defined as ≥45° change in vessel direction) along main trunk of at least one artery in systole and in diastole. _	0
Patients with or without CAD were further divided into CT-positive and CT-negative groups, all patients were followed up for the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for 2 to 4 years. _	0
In this paper we give a new example of duality between fragmentation and coagulation operators. `	1
We introduce families of random fragmentation and coagulation operators $\mathrm {Frag}_{\alpha}$ and $\mathrm {Coag}_{\alpha,\theta}$, respectively, with the following property: if the input to $\mathrm {Frag}_{\alpha}$ has $\operatorname {PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ distribution, then the output has $\operatorname {PD}(\alpha,\theta+1)$ distribution, while the reverse is true for $\mathrm {Coag}_{\alpha,\theta}$. _	1
Repeated application of the $\mathrm {Frag}_{\alpha}$ operators gives rise to a family of fragmentation chains. @	1
We show that these Markov chains can be encoded naturally by certain random recursive trees, and use this representation to give an alternative and more concrete proof of the coagulation--fragmentation duality. @	1
Consider the space of partitions of mass (i.e., decreasing sequences of nonnegative real numbers whose sum is 1) and the two-parameter family of Poisson--Dirichlet distributions $\operatorname {PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ that take values in this space. `	0
This result may be proved using a subordinator representation and it provides a companion set of relations to those of Pitman between $\operatorname {PD}(\alpha,\theta)$ and $\operatorname {PD}(\alpha\beta,\theta)$. _	0
The work proposes the application of Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) approach is selection of optimal road traffic noise barrier. _	1
It is suggested that application of this approach can be very helpful in selection and application of optimal noise barrier for road traffic noise abatement. @	1
The paper presents a retrospective study for selection of noise barrier for road traffic noise abatement. `	0
The present work utilizes the fuzzy TOPSIS model proposed by Mahdavi et al . @	0
(2008) in determination of ranking order of various types of noise barriers with respect to the various criteria considered. @	0
In this review, we describe the common in vitro and in vivo models of lymphangiogenesis that have proven suitable for investigating lymphatic biology and the interactions occurring between lymphatic vessels and other cells, such as immune cells and cancer cells. @	1
Their rationales and limitations are discussed and illustrated by the most informative findings obtained with them. @	1
Lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new lymphatic vessels from preexisting ones, is an important biological process associated with diverse pathologies, such as metastatic dissemination and graft rejection. `	0
In addition, lymphatic hypoplasia characterizes lymphedema, usually a progressive and lifelong condition for which no curative treatment exists. `	0
Much progress has been made in recent years in identifying molecules specifically expressed on lymphatic vessels and in the setting up of in vitro and in vivo models of lymphangiogenesis. _	0
These new tools rapidly provided an abundance of information on the mechanisms underlying lymphatic development and the progression of diseases associated with lymphatic dysfunction. _	0
We demonstrated that wt TRIF associates with tumor necrosis factor-a receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) better than (Δ160-181) TRIF, culminating in its greater ubiquitination and proteolysis. _	1
This explains, in part, the differential expression levels of the two TRIF proteins. _	1
Despite higher expression levels in transfected cells, (Δ160-181) TRIF inefficiently transactivated the IFN pathway, whereas the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation remained similar to that by wt TRIF. @	1
In coexpression studies, (Δ160-181) TRIF marginally contributed to the IFN pathway activation, but still enhanced NF-κB signaling with wt TRIF. @	1
Therefore, this 21 amino acid sequence is crucial for TRAF3 association, modulation of TRIF stability and activation of the IFN pathway. @	1
Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-ß (IFN-ß) factor (TRIF) is a key adaptor for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR4 signaling. `	0
Using a novel cDNA isolate encoding a TRIF protein with a 21-residue deletion (Δ160-181) from its amino-terminal half, we investigated the impact of this deletion on TRIF functions. `	0
Transfection studies consistently showed higher expression levels of the (Δ160-181) TRIF compared to wild-type (wt) TRIF, an effect unrelated to apoptosis, cell lines or plasmid amplification. `	0
Colocalization of wt and (Δ160-181) TRIF proteins led to a dramatic reduction of their respective expressions, suggesting that wt/(Δ160-181) TRIF heterocomplexes are targeted for degradation. _	0
The observed protection resulted from TCR-γ/δ cell–mediated arrest of both viral replication and neurovirulence. @	1
The demonstration that TCR-γ/δ cells play an important protective role in murine HSV-1 infections supports their potential contribution to the immune responses in human HSV-1 infection. @	1
Thus, this study demonstrates that TCR-γ/δ cells may play an important regulatory role in human HSV-1 infections. @	1
Increased numbers of T cell receptor (TCR)-γ/δ cells have been observed in animal models of influenza and sendai virus infections, as well as in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). `	0
However, a direct role for TCR-γ/δ cells in protective immunity for pathogenic viral infection has not been demonstrated. `	0
To define the role of TCR-γ/δ cells in anti–HSV-1 immunity, TCR-α−/− mice treated with anti– TCR-γ/δ monoclonal antibodies or TCR-γ/δ × TCR-α/β double-deficient mice were infected with HSV-1 by footpad or ocular routes of infection. _	0
In both models of HSV-1 infection, TCR-γ/δ cells limited severe HSV-1–induced epithelial lesions and greatly reduced mortality by preventing the development of lethal viral encephalitis. _	0
RESULTS Most patients (92%) had stage I-II disease. `	1
A germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) immunophenotype was observed in 61%, and BCL2 expression in 55%, of WR DLBCLs. _	1
BCL2, BCL6, IRF4 and MYC breakpoints were observed in, respectively, 3 of 42 (7%), 9 of 36 (25%), 2 of 26 (8%) and 4 of 40 (10%) contributive cases. _	1
A variable follicular pattern was evidenced in 30 of 68 (44%) large biopsy specimens. _	1
The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) of 153 WR DLBCL patients with survival information were 69.5% and 77.8%, respectively. @	1
The GCB immunophenotype correlated with a better OS (P = 0.0015), while BCL2 expression predicted a worse OS (P = 0.037), an effect overcome by the GCB/non-GCB classification. @	1
Compared with matched nodal DLBCLs, WR DLBCLs with no age-adjusted international prognostic index factor disclosed a better 5-year PFS rate (77.5% versus 70.7%; P = 0.03). @	1
CONCLUSIONS WR DLBCLs display distinct clinicopathologic features compared with conventional DLBCLs, with usual localized-stage disease, common follicular features and a high frequency of GCB immunophenotype contrasting with a low rate of BCL2 rearrangements. @	1
In addition, they seem to be associated with a better outcome than their nodal counterpart. @	1
BACKGROUND Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) arising in specific extranodal sites have peculiar clinicopathologic features. `	0
PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed a cohort of 187 primary Waldeyer's ring (WR) DLBCLs retrieved from GELA protocols using anthracyclin-based polychemotherapy. `	0
RESULTS The serum PG I level was statistically higher in the control group and in the patient group with chronic nonspecific gastritis compared to the patient groups with chronic atrophic gastritis and stomach cancer (p<0.05). _	1
The best cutoff values for diagnosing stomach cancer using serum PG I and PG I / PG II ratios were found to be <25 ng/ml for PG I and <3.0 for PG I / PG II. @	1
The same cut-off values were also most effective for the patients with atrophic gastritis. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Serum pepsinogen screening was shown to be a practical predictor of stomach cancer and atrophic gastritis, the most important predisposing lesion for stomach cancer. @	1
Although the diagnosis of stomach cancers localized in the pylorus and cardia via this method is difficult, we believe that the detection of early-stage cancers that develop following chronic atrophic gastritis in particular will be possible, and therefore the morbidity and mortality of stomach cancer will be decreased. @	1
OBJECTIVE The purpose of our study was to research the applicability of measuring serum pepsinogen I (PG I) and PG I/pepsinogen II (PG II) ratios as screening tests for atrophic gastritis, which is the most important predisposition for stomach cancer. `	0
MATERIALS AND METHODS We measured serum pepsinogen levels in non-specific gastritis, atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer using a radioimmunoassay method. `	0
We included in this study 30 healthy control, 30 nonspecific gastritis, 30 atrophic gastritis and 50 gastric cancer cases. _	0
RESULTS We found that the liver was the major site of initial uptake of (65)ZnO ENPs. _	1
There was a time-dependent decrease in tissue levels of (65)Zn in all organs examined, refecting particle dissolution. _	1
In vivo magnetometry showed a time-dependent and transient reduction in Kupffer cell phagosomal motility. _	1
Animals challenged with P. aeruginosa 24 hours post-ZnO ENP injection showed an initial (30 minutes) delay in vascular bacterial clearance. @	1
However, by 4 hours, IV-injected bacteria were cleared from the blood, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. @	1
Seven days post-ZnO ENP injection, creatine phosphokinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum were significantly increased. @	1
Histological evidence of hepatocyte damage and marginated neutrophils were observed in the liver. @	1
CONCLUSION Administration of ZnO ENPs transiently inhibited Kupffer cell phagosomal motility and later induced hepatocyte injury, but did not alter bacterial clearance from the blood or killing in the liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys. @	1
Our data show that diminished Kupffer cell organelle motion correlated with ZnO ENP-induced liver injury. @	1
BACKGROUND Zinc oxide engineered nanoparticles (ZnO ENPs) have potential as nanomedicines due to their inherent properties. `	0
Studies have described their pulmonary impact, but less is known about the consequences of ZnO ENP interactions with the liver. `	0
This study was designed to describe the effects of ZnO ENPs on the liver and Kupffer cells after intravenous (IV) administration. `	0
MATERIALS AND METHODS First, pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to determine the tissue distribution of neutron-activated (65)ZnO ENPs post-IV injection in Wistar Han rats. `	0
Then, a noninvasive in vivo method to assess Kupffer cell phagosomal motility was employed using ferromagnetic iron particles and magnetometry. `	0
We also examined whether prior IV injection of ZnO ENPs altered Kupffer cell bactericidal activity on circulating Pseudomonas aeruginosa. _	0
Serum and liver tissues were collected to assess liver-injury biomarkers and histological changes, respectively. _	0
Here we evaluated the antibacterial effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant and mucolytic agent, against mature multispecies endodontic biofilms consisting of Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis on sterile human dentin blocks. `	1
The biofilms were exposed to NAC (25, 50 and 100mg/mL), saturated calcium hydroxide or 2% chlorhexidine solution for 7 days, then examined by scanning electron microscopy. _	1
The biofilm viability was measured by viable cell counts and ATP-bioluminescence assay. _	1
NAC showed greater efficacy in biofilm cell removal and killing than the other root canal medicaments. @	1
Furthermore, 100mg/mL NAC disrupted the mature multispecies endodontic biofilms completely. @	1
These results demonstrate the potential use of NAC in root canal treatment. @	1
Removal of bacterial biofilm from the root canal system is essential for the management of endodontic disease. `	0
A trend towards over-representation of super-haplogroup U was the only evidence for association with mtDNA that we identified in these samples. @	1
In a parallel analysis of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes, we also found a trend towards association with the complex I gene, NDUFS2. @	1
These results add to the evidence suggesting that variation in mtDNA and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes may contribute to disease susceptibility in multiple sclerosis. @	1
Several lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial genetic factors may influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. `	0
To explore this hypothesis further, we re-sequenced the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) from 159 patients with multiple sclerosis and completed a haplogroup analysis including a further 835 patients and 1,506 controls. _	0
Here we describe neural circuits and associated algorithms that respect the brain's most basic resource constraints and support the execution of high numbers of cognitive actions when presented with natural inputs. _	1
Our circuits simultaneously support a suite of four basic kinds of task, each requiring some circuit modification: hierarchical memory formation, pairwise association, supervised memorization, and inductive learning of threshold functions. _	1
The capacity of our circuits is established by experiments in which sequences of several thousand such actions are simulated by computer and the circuits created tested for subsequent efficacy. @	1
Our underlying theory is apparently the only biologically plausible systems-level theory of learning and memory in cortex for which such a demonstration has been performed, and we argue that no general theory of information processing in the brain can be considered viable without such a demonstration. @	1
Over a lifetime, cortex performs a vast number of different cognitive actions, mostly dependent on experience. `	0
Previously it has not been known how such capabilities can be reconciled, even in principle, with the known resource constraints on cortex, such as low connectivity and low average synaptic strength. `	0
What we found in this study is that unintended learning could occur when students got interested in something in the first place and could maintain their interest. _	1
In addition, students could get conceptual knowledge when they tried to connect their experience to their related prior knowledge. _	1
It was also found that the processes of intended learning and of unintended learning were different. @	1
Intended learning was characterized by having been planned by the teacher who then sought to generate students’ interest in it. @	1
In contrast, unintended learning originated from students’ spontaneous interest and curiosity as a result of unplanned opportunities. @	1
Whilst teachers’ persuasive passion comes first in the process of intended learning, students’ heuristic passion comes first in the process of unintended learning. @	1
Based on these findings, we argue that teachers need to be more aware that unintended learning, on the part of individual students, can occur during their lesson and to be able to better use this opportunity so that this unintended learning can be shared by the whole class. @	1
Furthermore, we argue that teachers’ deliberate action and a more interactive classroom culture are necessary in order to allow students to develop, in addition to heuristic passion, persuasive passion towards their unintended learning. @	1
This study explored, from the perspective of intellectual passion developed by Michael Polanyi, the unintended learning that occurred in primary practical science lessons. `	0
We use the term ‘unintended’ learning to distinguish it from ‘intended’ learning that appears in teachers’ learning objectives. `	0
Data were collected using video and audio recordings of a sample of twenty-four whole class practical science lessons, taught by five teachers, in Korean primary schools with 10- to 12-year-old students. `	0
In addition, video and audio recordings were made for each small group of students working together in order to capture their activities and intra-group discourse. `	0
Pre-lesson interviews with the teachers were undertaken and audio-recorded to ascertain their intended learning objectives. _	0
Selected key vignettes, including unintended learning, were analysed from the perspective of intellectual passion developed by Polanyi. _	0
All patients also responded to a Global Assessment Question, ‘Has the treatment you have been taking during this study improved your erections?’ After 24 weeks, mean IIEF-5 score, mean VAS score and mean EDITS score improved significantly in patients receiving CoQ10 (all P<0.01). @	1
Mean plaque size and mean penile curvature degree were decreased in the CoQ10 group, whereas a slight increase was noted in the placebo group (both P=0.001). @	1
Mean index of IIEF-5 in 24-week treatment period was 17.8±2.7 in the CoQ10 group and 8.8±1.5 in the placebo group (P=0.001). @	1
Of the patients in CoQ10 group, 11 (13.6%) had disease progression vs 46 (56.1%) in placebo group (P=0.01). @	1
In patients with early chronic PD, CoQ10 therapy leads plaque size and penile curvature reduction and improves EF. @	1
No oral medication has proved to be clearly beneficial for Peyronie's disease (PD). `	0
We investigated the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation in patients with early chronic PD. `	0
We conducted a randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with chronic early PD. `	0
Patients were randomly assigned to either 300 mg CoQ10 daily (n=93) or similar regimen of placebo (n=93) for 24 weeks. _	0
Erectile function (EF), pain during erection, plaque volume, penile curvature and treatment satisfaction using patient versions of the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire were assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks during study period. _	0
EF was assessed using International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS, 0–10). _	0
No overall excess of gastric cancer was found (15 cases v 17.0 expected; SIR = 0.89). @	1
No association was found between cumulated exposure to nitrate and gastric cancer, and there was no association between duration of employment or time since first employment and incidence of gastric cancer. @	1
The incidence of cancer among 2023 male fertiliser workers has been investigated in a historical cohort study. `	0
Workers who had been employed for more than one year in work with possible exposure to dust containing nitrate between 1945 and 1979 were included. `	0
An individual cumulated exposure to dust expressed in level-years was calculated for each participant. _	0
The cohort was followed up from 1953 to the end of 1988, and the incidence of cancer was compared with the national rates. _	0
There were 467 deaths v 504.8 expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 0.93), and 185 cases of cancer v 195.5 expected (standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 0.95). @	0
Thirty cases of lung cancer were found v 27.5 expected (SIR = 1.09). @	0
Here we show that PHOSPHO1, a phosphatase with specificity for phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine, plays a functional role in the initiation of calcification and that ablation of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP function prevents skeletal mineralization. _	1
Phospho1(-/-) mice display growth plate abnormalities, spontaneous fractures, bowed long bones, osteomalacia, and scoliosis in early life. _	1
Primary cultures of Phospho1(-/-) tibial growth plate chondrocytes and chondrocyte-derived matrix vesicles (MVs) show reduced mineralizing ability, and plasma samples from Phospho1(-/-) mice show reduced levels of TNAP and elevated plasma PP(i) concentrations. @	1
However, transgenic overexpression of TNAP does not correct the bone phenotype in Phospho1(-/-) mice despite normalization of their plasma PP(i) levels. @	1
In contrast, double ablation of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP function leads to the complete absence of skeletal mineralization and perinatal lethality. @	1
We conclude that PHOSPHO1 has a nonredundant functional role during endochondral ossification, and based on these data and a review of the current literature, we propose an inclusive model of skeletal calcification that involves intravesicular PHOSPHO1 function and P(i) influx into MVs in the initiation of mineralization and the functions of TNAP, nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase-1, and collagen in the extravesicular progression of mineralization. @	1
Endochondral ossification is a carefully orchestrated process mediated by promoters and inhibitors of mineralization. `	0
Phosphatases are implicated, but their identities and functions remain unclear. `	0
Alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) plays a crucial role promoting mineralization of the extracellular matrix by restricting the concentration of the calcification inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)). `	0
Mutations in the TNAP gene cause hypophosphatasia, a heritable form of rickets and osteomalacia. _	0
We leverage these operators to study coefficients of harmonic weak Maass forms. @	1
Although generic harmonic weak Maass forms are expected to have transcendental coefficients, we show that those forms which are ``dual'' under $\xi_{2-k}$ to newforms with vanishing Hecke eigenvalues (such as CM forms) have algebraic coefficients. @	1
Using regularized inner products, we also characterize the image of $D^{k-1}$. @	1
For integers $k\geq 2$, we study two differential operators on harmonic weak Maass forms of weight $2-k$. `	0
The operator $\xi_{2-k}$ (resp. `	0
$D^{k-1}$) defines a map to the space of weight $k$ cusp forms (resp. _	0
weakly holomorphic modular forms). _	0
Our proposed method initially involves segmentation process to identify blood vessel bifurcation points in the retina, and then the generation of template consisting of the bifurcation points in the blood vessels and the template is transformed using Noninvertible construction (NIC) algorithm and finally matching of the bifurcation points in different patterns. _	1
Our work mainly focused to provide the efficient person authentication and the secured biometric template, which has the unique patterns of blood vessels. @	1
The effectiveness of our proposed system is then verified with experimental results using a total of 603 retinal images from three different publicly available databases, namely DRIVE, VARIA and STARE. @	1
Also we have made a performance analysis, and found that the proposed retinal recognition method gives 100%, 98% and 93% recognition rates, 0%, 0.16%, 0.62% error rates for the above databases and analyzed the Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR), False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FAR), Elapsed time respectively. @	1
The experimental results obtained using various databases shows that the application of Retinal feature extraction algorithm (RFEA) and NCI results in higher recognition rates and lower error rates. @	1
Cancelable biometrics is a good approach to address the security and privacy concerns on biometric authentication. `	0
The security of cancelable biometrics lies on non invertibility of the transformed templates. `	0
So the transforms should be noninvertible and the original biometric template cannot be recovered. _	0
Our data show that opioid drugs (heroin and morphine) are more toxic than stimulant drugs (d-amphetamine and cocaine). _	1
Toxic effects induced by heroin are associated with a decrease in intracellular dopamine, an increase in DOPAC levels, and the formation of ROS, whereas toxic effects induced by amphetamine are associated with a decrease in intracellular dopamine and in ATP/ADP levels. _	1
In contrast with cocaine, both amphetamine and heroin induced features of apoptosis. @	1
The data suggest that the death of cultured PC12 cells induced by the drugs of abuse is correlated with a decrease in intracellular dopamine levels, which can be associated with an increased dopamine turnover and oxidative cell injury. @	1
Cell death and reactive oxygen species production have been suggested to be involved in neurodegeneration induced by the drugs of abuse. `	0
In this study we analyze the toxicity of the following drugs of abuse: heroin, morphine, d-amphetamine, and cocaine in undifferentiated PC12 cells, used as dopaminergic neuronal models. `	0
In isolated rat atria, yangambin (0.1 µM-1 mM) had very slight negative inotropic (Emax = 35.6% ± 6.4%) and chronotropic effects (Emax = 10.2% ± 2.9%). _	1
In endothelium-intact rat mesenteric artery, yangambin (0.1 µM-1 mM) induced concentration-dependent relaxation (pD2 = 4.5 ± 0.06) of contractions induced by phenylephrine and this effect was not affected by removal of the endothelium. _	1
Interestingly, like nifedipine, the relaxant effect induced by yangambin was more potent on the contractile response induced by KCl 80 mM (pD2 = 4.8 ± 0.05) when compared to that induced by phenylephrine. _	1
Furthermore, yangambin inhibited CaCl2-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. @	1
This lignan also induced relaxation (pD2 = 4.0 ± 0.04) of isolated arteries pre-contracted with S(-)-Bay K 8644. @	1
In fura-2/AM-loaded myocytes of rat mesenteric arteries, yangambin inhibited the Ca2+ signal evoked by KCl 60 mM. @	1
In conclusion, these results suggest that the hypotensive effect of yangambin is probably due to a peripheral vasodilatation that involves, at least, the inhibition the Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. @	1
The pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular system of yangambin, a lignan isolated from Ocotea duckei Vattimo (Lauraceae), were studied in rats using combined functional and biochemical approaches. `	0
In non-anaesthetized rats, yangambin (1, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg/kg, i.v.) `	0
induced hypotension (-3.5 ± 0.2; -7.1 ± 0.8; -8.9 ± 1.3; -14 ± 2.3, -25.5% ± 2.6%, respectively) accompanied by tachycardia (5.9 ± 0.5; 5.9 ± 1.6; 8.8 ± 1.4; 11.6, 18.8% ± 3.4%, respectively). `	0
RESULTS Multiple SNPs in the FGFR2 locus were significantly associated with contralateral breast cancer, including rs1219648 (per allele rate ratio (RR) = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.08-1.45). _	1
Statistically significant associations with contralateral breast cancer were also observed at rs7313833, near the PTHLH gene (per allele RR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.08-1.47), rs13387042 (2q35) (per allele RR = 1.19, 95%CI = 1.02-1.37), rs13281615 (8q24) (per allele RR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.04-1.40), and rs11235127 near TMEM135 (per allele RR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.04-1.53). @	1
The A allele of rs13387042 (2q35) was significantly associated with contralateral breast cancer in ER negative first tumors while the A allele of rs11235127 (near TMEM135) was significantly associated with contralateral breast cancer in ER positive first tumors. @	1
Although some SNP genotypes appeared to modify contralateral breast cancer risk with respect to tamoxifen treatment or particular radiation doses, trend tests for such effects were not significant. @	1
CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that some common risk variants associated with primary breast cancer also increase risk for contralateral breast cancer, and that these risks vary with the ER status of the first tumor. @	1
INTRODUCTION Genome-wide association studies, focusing primarily on unilateral breast cancer, have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of genomic regions that have alleles associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer. `	0
In the current study we evaluate the contributions of these previously identified regions to the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. `	0
The most strongly disease-associated SNPs from prior studies were tested for association with contralateral breast cancer. `	0
A subset of these SNPs, selected upon their main effects on contralateral breast cancer risk was further evaluated for interaction with treatment modalities and estrogen receptor (ER) status. `	0
METHODS We genotyped 21 SNPs in 708 women with contralateral breast cancer and 1394 women with unilateral breast cancer who serve as the cases and controls in the Women's Environment, Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. _	0
Records of treatment and ER status were available for most of WECARE Study participants. _	0
Associations of SNP genotypes and risk for contralateral breast cancer were calculated with multivariable adjusted conditional logistic regression methods. _	0
Results: Children over 5 years of age constituted the highest number (87%) of cases. _	1
Peak incidence of poisoning (71%) was observed during the months of Asadh- Bhadra (June-September). _	1
Most of the bites (61%) were by unidentified snakes, most commonly (91%) on the extremities. _	1
Snakebite envenomation occurred more frequently (52%) during night time. _	1
85% of children had local or systemic complications, commonest being respiratory paralysis(92/152).Case fatality rate (CFR) was 28%. @	1
Risk factors for death were: age < 5 years; bites by unidentified snakes and kraits and bites on ears & unknown sites. @	1
Conclusion : Compared with adults, children with snake envenomation have higher morbidity and mortality, which can be minimized by early diagnosis, appropriate treatment and close monitoring of children on ventilation for the timely management of complications. @	1
Emphasis should be given on developing a standard management protocol in children. @	1

Only 1 patient discontinued sorafenib treatment permanently due to severe toxicities. _	1
Dose reduction or interruption was required in 12 patients (40%) who developed adverse events of grade 3 or 4. @	1
Seven of these patients tolerated the dose of 600 mg per day well, and experienced clinical benefit. @	1
The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test revealed that the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) status was a prognostic factor for PFS and OS in advanced RCC. @	1
The long-term efficacy and safety of sorafenib were confirmed in Chinese advanced RCC patients who showed an even greater benefit in PFS. @	1
The findings of this study indicate that a dose of 600 mg instead of 400 mg per day may be an optimal choice for Asian patients when a reduction of the initial dose is required. @	1
Sorafenib has been confirmed as an effective drug in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). `	0
This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of sorafenib in ethnic Chinese patients with advanced RCC, and to develop optimal treatment strategies for Asian patients. `	0
Between May 2006 and August 2011, 30 patients with advanced RCC were treated with sorafenib in the Oncology Center, Tongji Hospital. `	0
All 30 patients received continuous treatment with 400 mg of sorafenib orally twice daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicities or mortality occurred. `	0
Dose reduction to 600 mg daily or even less was required if toxicities of grade 3 or 4 occurred. `	0
Patients were assessed for tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and drug-related toxicities. _	0
The median follow-up time was 58 weeks (range, 12-270). _	0
Among the 30 patients, 1 patient had complete remission (CR 3.3%), 4 patients had partial remission (PR 13.3%), 19 patients had stable disease (SD 63.3%) and 6 patients had disease progression (PD 20%). _	0
The disease control rate (DCR, CR+PR+SD) was 80%, the median PFS time was 14 months, and the median OS time was 16 months. _	0
In this paper, we discuss verification of opacity and diagnosability for infinite-state DESs modeled by pushdown automata (called here pushdown systems). `	1
First, we discuss opacity of pushdown systems and prove that opacity of pushdown systems is in general undecidable. _	1
In addition, a decidable class is clarified. _	1
Next, in diagnosability, we prove that under a certain assumption, which is different from the assumption in the existing result, diagnosability of pushdown systems is decidable. @	1
Furthermore, a necessary condition and a sufficient condition using finite-state approximations are derived. @	1
Finally, as one of the applications, we consider data integration using XML (Extensible Markup Language). @	1
The obtained result is useful for developing control theory of infinite-state DESs. @	1
In control theory of discrete event systems (DESs), one of the challenging topics is the extension of theory of finite-state DESs to that of infinite-state DESs. `	0
RESULTS We identified 56 cohort and case-control studies and 74 individual relative risk (RR) estimates on stomach cancer and Cr(VI) exposure or work in an occupation associated with high Cr(VI) exposure including chromium production, chrome plating, leather work and work with Portland cement. _	1
The summary RR for all studies combined was 1.27 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.38). @	1
In analyses limited to only those studies identifying increased risks of lung cancer, the summary RR for stomach cancer was higher (RR=1.41, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.69). @	1
CONCLUSIONS Overall, these results suggest that Cr(VI) is a stomach carcinogen in humans, which is consistent with the tumour results reported in rodent studies. @	1
OBJECTIVES Chromium VI (hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI)) is an established cause of lung cancer, but its association with gastrointestinal cancer is less clear. `	0
The goal of this study was to examine whether the current human epidemiological research on occupationally inhaled Cr(VI) supports the hypothesis that Cr(VI) is associated with human stomach cancer. `	0
METHODS Following a thorough literature search and review of individual studies, we used meta-analysis to summarise the current epidemiological literature on inhaled Cr(VI) and stomach cancer, explore major sources of heterogeneity, and assess other elements of causal inference. _	0
RESULTS We observed increased protein levels of Rsk1 and Rsk2 in the striatum of Hdh(Q111/Q111) and R6/1 mice, STHdh(Q111/Q111) cells and striatal cells transfected with full-length mhtt. _	1
Analysis of the phosphorylation of Rsk in Hdh mice and STHdh cells showed reduced levels of phospho Ser-380 (dependent on ERK1/2), whereas phosphorylation at Ser-221 (dependent on PDK1) was increased. _	1
Moreover, we found that elevated Rsk activity in STHdh(Q111/Q111) cells was mainly due to PDK1 activity, as assessed by transfection with Rsk mutant constructs. _	1
The increase of Rsk in STHdh(Q111/Q111) cells occurred in the cytosol and in the nucleus, which results in enhanced phosphorylation of both cytosolic and nuclear Rsk targets. @	1
Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Rsk, knock-down and overexpression experiments indicated that Rsk activity exerts a protective effect against mhtt-induced cell death in STHdh(Q7/Q7) cells transfected with mhtt. @	1
CONCLUSION The increase of Rsk levels and activity would act as a compensatory mechanism with capacity to prevent mhtt-mediated cell death. @	1
We propose Rsk as a good target for neuroprotective therapies in HD. @	1
BACKGROUND The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (Rsk) family is involved in cell survival. `	0
Rsk activation is regulated by sequential phosphorylations controlled by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). `	0
Altered ERK1/2 and PDK1 phosphorylation have been described in Huntington's disease (HD), characterized by the expression of mutant huntingtin (mhtt) and striatal degeneration. `	0
However, the role of Rsk in this neurodegenerative disease remains unknown. `	0
Here, we analyzed the protein levels, activity and role of Rsk in in vivo and in vitro HD models. _	0
RESULTS Personal social relationships were mentioned significantly more often as important for QoL than health-related aspects, and in direct comparison were weighted significantly stronger. _	1
Regarding the change of areas relevant for QoL over the time elapsed since diagnosis, there was a significant difference between groups concerning the area of spirituality. @	1
Satisfaction differed significantly between groups for the field of leisure. @	1
CONCLUSION The results for the interviewed patients with multiple myeloma point out the need to take into account the importance of social and individual aspects when reflecting on QoL. @	1
Similar findings have been reported for different samples. @	1
The relevance of an individualized approach is illustrated by the fact that individually named areas of life were rated comparatively strongly in their importance for the patients' QoL. @	1
An overall assessment for the current QoL by means of VAS is regarded as an adequate supplement to the SEIQoL-Profile and an alternative to the SEIQoL-DW-Index. @	1
OBJECTIVE The situation of patients with multiple myeloma, whose treatment often implies high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation that can be associated with severe symptoms and psychological distress, has gained attention in recent psychooncological research. `	0
This study followed an idiographic approach in order to identify the areas of life most relevant for the interviewed myeloma patients' quality of life (QoL) as well as their current satisfaction with these. `	0
METHODS 64 patients took part in semi-structured interviews according to the SEIQoL-DW Manual (Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life - Direct Weighting). `	0
Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to gain additional information about a general assessment of the present QoL. `	0
Qualitative data evaluation preceded quantitative processing. _	0
Groups were compared according to the time elapsed since diagnosis regarding specified areas of life, satisfaction with these and their relative weighting. _	0
SEIQoL-DW-indices were correlated to the VAS to reflect on an interindividually comparable parameter. _	0
